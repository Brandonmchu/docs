## Overview

Every works as a full **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - you can install it on your phone or tablet for a native app experience, complete with offline access, faster loading, and a dedicated home screen icon.

## Benefits of Installing

**Faster Performance:**
- Instant startup with cached resources
- Reduced data usage with smart caching
- Pre-loaded fonts and assets

**Native App Experience:**
- No browser chrome (address bar, tabs)
- Full-screen interface
- Dedicated app icon on home screen
- Swipe gestures work naturally

**Offline Capability:**
- View previously loaded invoices and clients
- Access cached data without internet
- Queue actions to sync when back online

**Better Mobile UX:**
- Optimized touch targets
- Native scrolling behavior
- Platform-specific animations
- System integration (share sheets, etc.)

## Android Installation

### Automatic Install Prompt (Recommended)

Chrome on Android automatically shows an install banner after you've used Every a few times:

1. Visit Every in Chrome on your Android device
2. Use Every normally (browse 2+ pages, spend 5+ minutes)
3. Chrome shows "Install Every" banner at the bottom
4. Tap **Install** to add to home screen
5. App appears on home screen and app drawer

<Note>
  The automatic prompt appears after you've engaged with Every meaningfully - Chrome wants to ensure you actually use the app before prompting to install.
</Note>

### Manual Install

If you don't see the automatic prompt:

1. Open Every in Chrome on Android
2. Tap the menu icon (⋮) in the top-right corner
3. Tap **"Install app"** or **"Add to Home Screen"**
4. Confirm the app name and icon
5. Tap **"Install"** or **"Add"**
6. App appears on your home screen

<Tip>
  Make sure you're using Chrome - other Android browsers may not support PWA installation.
</Tip>

## iOS Installation (iPhone/iPad)

iOS requires manual installation via Safari:

1. Open Every in **Safari** on your iPhone or iPad
2. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow pointing up)
3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
4. Customize the app name if desired (default is "Every")
5. Tap **"Add"** in the top-right corner
6. App appears on your home screen

<Note>
  **Important:** You must use Safari on iOS. Chrome and other browsers on iOS do not support PWA installation.
</Note>

## What Gets Cached (Offline Access)

When installed, Every caches:

**Pages You've Visited:**
- Invoice list and individual invoices
- Client list and client details
- Expense and time tracking pages
- Settings pages

**Data Loaded:**
- Previously fetched invoices (up to the last 50)
- Client records you've viewed
- Recent activity timeline

**Assets:**
- Fonts (for consistent branding)
- Icons and UI elements
- Stylesheets and layouts
- JavaScript application code

<Warning>
  Offline access is **read-only**. Creating new invoices or modifying data requires an internet connection to sync with the server.
</Warning>

## Updating the App

Every automatically updates when we deploy new features:

1. You'll see a notification: "New version available"
2. Tap **"Reload"** to update instantly
3. Or close and reopen the app to update next launch

**Automatic update detection** happens when:
- App launches after being closed
- You've been idle for several hours
- We deploy a critical bug fix

<Tip>
  You don't need to manually check for updates or reinstall the app. Every handles updates automatically.
</Tip>

## Cache Versioning & Error Recovery

Every uses versioned caching to prevent issues:

- **Cache names include version numbers** (e.g., `api-cache-v2`)
- **Old caches are automatically cleaned up** when versions change
- **Error recovery is automatic** - if the app detects stale code, it refreshes automatically

**If you see "Load failed" errors:**

The app includes automatic recovery:
1. Every detects the error
2. Shows: "Updating app to fix connection issue..."
3. Reloads automatically with fresh code

If the error persists:
1. Close the app completely
2. Reopen it to trigger a fresh load
3. If still failing, uninstall and reinstall

## Uninstalling the App

### Android

1. Long-press the Every app icon on your home screen
2. Tap **"App info"** or drag to **"Uninstall"**
3. Confirm uninstall

Or:

1. Go to Settings → Apps → Every
2. Tap "Uninstall"

### iOS

1. Long-press the Every app icon on your home screen
2. Tap **"Remove App"**
3. Tap **"Delete App"** (not "Remove from Home Screen")
4. Confirm deletion

<Note>
  Uninstalling the PWA does not delete your data on the server. You can reinstall anytime and all your invoices, clients, and settings will still be there.
</Note>

## Differences Between Web & Installed App

| Feature | Web (Browser) | Installed (PWA) |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Startup Speed** | Varies with connection | Instant (cached) |
| **Offline Access** | None | Read-only cached data |
| **Address Bar** | Visible | Hidden (full screen) |
| **Browser Tabs** | Shared with other sites | Dedicated app window |
| **Home Screen Icon** | None (bookmark optional) | Dedicated icon |
| **Push Notifications** | Limited support | Full support (coming soon) |
| **Updates** | Automatic | Automatic with prompt |

## Technical Details

**Requirements:**
- **Android**: Chrome 67+ on Android 5.0+
- **iOS**: Safari on iOS 11.3+
- **HTTPS**: Every runs on HTTPS (required for PWA)

**Installation Eligibility (Android automatic prompt):**
- User has visited Every on at least 2 occasions
- At least 5 minutes have elapsed between visits
- Site is served over HTTPS
- Includes a web app manifest
- Has a registered service worker

**Analytics:**
- We track PWA installation for product insights:
  - `pwa_install_prompt_available` (banner shown)
  - `pwa_install_completed` (user installed)
  - `pwa_app_launched` (opened from home screen)
- All analytics are aggregated and anonymous

## Troubleshooting

**Android: "Install" option not showing**
- Ensure you're using Chrome (not Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Visit at least 2 different pages in Every
- Spend at least 5 minutes total on site
- Check that you're on HTTPS (should show lock icon)
- Try the manual install via Chrome menu (⋮) → "Install app"

**iOS: "Add to Home Screen" missing**
- Must use Safari (Chrome on iOS does not support PWAs)
- Check that you're tapping the Share button (not the Tabs button)
- Scroll down in the share sheet to find "Add to Home Screen"

**App shows outdated content**
- Close app completely (swipe up from recent apps)
- Reopen to trigger cache refresh
- If persists, uninstall and reinstall

**"Load failed" error after update**
- Every should auto-recover (shows "Updating app..." message)
- If not, force-close and reopen
- Last resort: uninstall and reinstall (data is safe on server)

**App takes up too much storage**
- PWA caches can grow over time (typically 10-50MB)
- Uninstall and reinstall to clear cache
- Or clear Safari/Chrome app data for Every
