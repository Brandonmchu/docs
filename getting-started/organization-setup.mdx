description: "Configure your Every organization settings, branding, and defaults"

## Overview

Your organization stores business information, branding, payment settings, and financial defaults that appear on all invoices and proposals.

<Note>
  Complete this setup before creating invoices or adding clients for best results.
</Note>

## Business Profile

Your profile appears on all invoices, proposals, and client-facing documents.

### Setup

Go to **Settings** → **Organization** and enter:

**Business Name** (Required) - Appears prominently on all invoices

**Contact Information**
- Email and phone for client communications
- Full address (street, city, state/province, postal code, country)
- Website URL (optional)

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Update my business name to Acme Consulting LLC" or "Set my business address to 123 Main Street, Toronto, ON M5V 1A1, Canada"
</Tip>

## Branding & Customization

Make your invoices match your brand identity.

### Logo Upload

Go to **Invoices** → **Customize** → **Upload Logo** (PNG, JPG, or SVG)

- Recommended: 200x200px to 400x400px with transparent background
- Appears on all invoices and public pages

### Brand Color

Select your primary brand color in **Settings** → **Organization**. Applied to invoices, public pages, and buttons.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Change my brand color to #0066CC" or "Set my brand color to navy blue"
</Tip>

### Invoice Note Templates

Create reusable note templates in **Invoices** → **Customize** for common invoice notes like payment terms, thank you messages, and instructions.

**To create a template:**
1. Go to **Invoices** → **Customize**
2. Click **Add Note Template**
3. Name your template (e.g., "Net 30 Terms")
4. Enter the note text
5. Optionally set as default for all new invoices

**Common templates:** Payment instructions, thank you messages, late payment policies, bank transfer details

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Create a note template for Net 30 payment terms" or "Set my default invoice note to thank clients for their business"
</Tip>

## Financial Configuration

### Default Currency

Choose USD or CAD in **Settings** → **Organization**. Used for all new invoices (can override per invoice).

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Change my default currency to USD" or "What's my current default currency?"
</Tip>

### Default Due Days

Set payment timeline (1-365 days) in **Settings** → **Organization**. Due date auto-calculates as: Issue Date + Default Due Days.

**Common values:** Net 15, Net 30 (most common), Net 60, Due on Receipt (0-1 days)

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Set my default payment terms to Net 30" or "Change my invoice due days to 45"
</Tip>

### Sales Tax Default

Set your standard tax percentage in **Settings** → **Organization**. Applied to new offerings and invoices.

**Common values:** 5% (Canadian GST), 13% (Ontario HST), 0% (no tax)

<Note>
  Tax rates can be overridden per line item on invoices.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Set my default tax rate to 13%" or "Change my sales tax to 5% for GST"
</Tip>

### Invoice Numbering

Automatic sequential numbering: `INV-001`, `INV-002`, `INV-003`, etc.

You can manually set custom numbers when creating invoices (useful when migrating from another system).

## Payment Processing Setup

### Stripe Integration

Enable online credit card payments on your invoices.

**Connect:** **Settings** → **Payments** → **Connect Stripe Account** → Complete onboarding (business details, bank account, identity verification)

**After connection:**
- Invoices include "Pay Now" button
- Payments process automatically through Stripe
- Funds deposit to your bank account
- Invoice status updates to **Paid** automatically
- Processing fees: Typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

**Account Status:**
- **Enabled**: Fully operational with payouts
- **Payouts Disabled**: Can accept payments, complete setup for payouts
- **Restricted**: Under review or needs more info

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Connect my Stripe account" or "What's my Stripe account status?"
</Tip>

### Manual Payment Methods

Without Stripe, you can still track offline payments (cash, check, bank transfer, credit card, other) in the invoice detail page.

## Tax Management

Set **Sales Tax Default** percentage in **Settings** → **Organization**. Applied to new offerings and invoices with automatic calculations.

All tax calculations are **tax-exclusive** (line item amount + tax = total). For example, a $100 line item with 13% tax = $113 total.

<Note>
  Tax rates can be set per-offering and overridden per line item on each invoice.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "What tax rate am I currently using?" or "Update my organization tax settings"
</Tip>

## How Organization Settings are Used

- **Invoices**: Business profile in headers, default currency, auto-calculated due dates, default notes
- **Branding**: Logo and brand color on all invoices and templates
- **Payments**: Stripe integration for online payments, automatic status tracking
- **Tax**: Default tax rate application and automatic calculations
- **Public Pages**: Branded invoice viewing for professional client experience

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Complete setup before creating invoices** - 10 minutes of configuration saves hours later.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use high-quality logo and set realistic due days** - Professional branding matters, and Net 30 is standard.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Connect Stripe early** - Clients pay significantly faster with online payment options.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

**Logo not appearing:** Check file size (under 5MB), format (PNG/JPG/SVG), re-upload, clear cache

**Stripe connection issues:** Complete all onboarding steps, verify bank account, check status in Settings → Payments

**Tax not calculating:** Verify sales tax default is set, check line item tax settings, enter rate as percentage (13, not 0.13)

**Default notes not appearing:** Save settings after adding notes, refresh invoice page, create new invoices (drafts keep old settings)
