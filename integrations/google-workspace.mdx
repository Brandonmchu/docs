## Overview

Google Workspace integration connects Every AI with your Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Contacts. Import contacts, send emails through the Agent, attach Drive files, and schedule meetings seamlessly.

**What You Can Do:**
- Import contacts from Google Contacts
- Send emails through Gmail (via Every Agent)
- Create and view calendar events
- Search and attach Google Drive files
- Automate workflows with Google services

## Connecting Google Workspace

### Quick Setup

Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Connect Google Account** → Select your Google account → Review permissions → Click Allow → Return to Every AI.

**Permissions Requested:**
- **Gmail:** Send emails, read messages
- **Calendar:** Read and write events
- **Drive:** View and search files
- **Contacts:** Read contact information

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Connect Google:
  - "Connect my Google Workspace account"
  - "Set up Google integration"
  - "Link my Gmail to Every AI"
</Tip>

<Note>
  You can grant partial permissions (e.g., only Contacts). Add more scopes later as needed.
</Note>

### Managing Scopes

Scopes define what Every AI can access. If a feature requires missing scopes, the app prompts you to reconnect and grant additional permissions.

**To Update:** Settings → Integrations → Reconnect Google → Grant additional permissions

## Gmail Integration

### Sending Emails via Agent

The Every Agent can send emails through your Gmail account:

**How It Works:** Chat with Agent ("Send an email to ACME Corp thanking them for payment") → Agent drafts email → You review → Approve → Sent from your Gmail

**Use Cases:**
- Invoice reminders and thank you messages
- Follow-ups and project updates
- Meeting confirmations
- Custom client communications

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Send emails:
  - "Send invoice INV-123 via Gmail to ACME Corp"
  - "Email a payment reminder to John Smith"
  - "Draft a follow-up email to my client about the proposal"
</Tip>

### Suggested Responses

Agent generates context-aware email suggestions (API: `/api/generate-suggested-messages`). View client message → Generate response → Select from 2-3 options → Customize → Send.

## Google Calendar Integration

### Managing Events

**Via Agent:** "Create a calendar event for my meeting with ACME Corp next Tuesday at 2 PM"

**Features:**
- Meeting title and description
- Date, time, and location
- Attendee invitations
- Reminders and notifications

**Use Cases:**
- Client meeting scheduling
- Invoice due date reminders
- Project milestone tracking
- Follow-up task scheduling

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Schedule meetings:
  - "Schedule a meeting with ACME Corp next Tuesday at 2 PM"
  - "Add a reminder for invoice follow-up on Friday"
  - "Set up a meeting with TechCo to discuss the proposal"
</Tip>

**Calendar Hook:** `useGoogleCalendar` - Fetch upcoming events, view details, create/update events

<Tip>
  Add invoice due dates to your calendar for automatic follow-up reminders!
</Tip>

## Google Drive Integration

### Searching and Attaching Files

**Drive Hook:** `useGoogleDrive` - Search by filename, file type, recent files, starred files, or specific folders

**Use Cases:**
- Find contracts to attach to invoices
- Locate project files and specifications
- Reference documentation
- Attach proposals and templates

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Search Drive:
  - "Find the ACME Corp contract in my Drive"
  - "Search for project specifications in Google Drive"
  - "Attach the proposal template from Drive"
</Tip>

### Attaching Files

Create/edit invoice or proposal → Click "Attach from Drive" → Search or browse → Select file → Link added → Client can access (based on Drive permissions)

**Supported:** Documents, Spreadsheets, Presentations, Images, PDFs, any file type in Drive

**Permissions:** File access managed in Google Drive. Consider making files public or sharing with client email.

## Google Contacts Integration

### Importing Contacts

**To Import:** Navigate to **Clients** → **Import from Google Contacts** → Select contacts → Click Import Selected → Contacts become clients in Every AI

**What's Imported:**
- Contact name, email, phone
- Company/organization name
- Addresses and notes

**Duplicate Prevention:** System checks existing clients by email and won't create duplicates

**One-Way Sync:** Import is one-time, not continuous. Changes in Google Contacts don't auto-update Every AI. Re-import to refresh.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Import contacts:
  - "Import my Google Contacts"
  - "Bring in contacts from Google"
  - "Add my Gmail contacts to Every AI"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Import contacts when starting with Every AI to save manual entry time!
</Tip>

### Client Enrichment

Google Contacts data is used for auto-enrichment (company names, addresses, professional details). You can also manually search Google Contacts from the client form and pull matching data.

## Every Agent Integration

The Agent leverages Google integrations with the `check_google_services_status` tool to verify connections before using features.

**Agent Capabilities:**
- Send Gmail emails
- Create calendar events
- Search Drive files
- Reference contact data
- Schedule follow-ups and reminders

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "Send invoice reminder to ACME Corp"
Agent: ✓ Checks Gmail connection
       ✓ Drafts professional reminder
       ✓ Sends via your Gmail
       ✓ Logs activity
```

## Managing Connection

### Connection Status

**View Status:** Settings → Integrations → Google Workspace section

**Status Indicators:**
- ✅ Connected
- ⚠️ Needs reconnection
- ❌ Not connected

**Health Info:** Last successful sync, active scopes, token expiration, error messages

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Check Google status:
  - "Check my Google Workspace connection status"
  - "Is Gmail connected?"
  - "What Google permissions do I have enabled?"
</Tip>

### Reconnecting

**When Needed:** Adding new scopes, token expired, connection error, or permission changes

**To Reconnect:** Settings → Integrations → Reconnect Google → Log in → Grant permissions

### Disconnecting

**To Disconnect:** Settings → Integrations → Google Workspace → Disconnect → Confirm

**What Happens:**
- Stored tokens removed
- Features become unavailable
- Historical data preserved (imported clients, past Drive links, email/calendar history)
- Can reconnect anytime

<Warning>
  Disconnecting removes integration features but doesn't delete imported data.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Common problems:** Wrong account selected, pop-up blocked, third-party cookies disabled, organization security policy

**Solutions:** Allow pop-ups for every.ai, enable third-party cookies, try different browser, check organization GSuite settings, or contact IT for corporate accounts

### Feature Not Working

**Check:** Connection status, required scopes granted, token not expired, internet connection

**Solution:** Reconnect Google account, grant missing scopes, refresh page, or contact support

### Service-Specific Issues

**Gmail not sending:** Verify `gmail.send` scope granted, email draft approved, check sent items in Gmail, or reconnect

**Calendar events not creating:** Verify Calendar scope granted, correct calendar selected, valid date/time, or reconnect

**Drive files not found:** Verify Drive scope granted, files exist, accurate search terms, check file permissions, or reconnect

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Import contacts early** - Start by importing Google Contacts to save manual data entry.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use Agent for emails** - Let Agent draft professional emails based on your data.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Link Drive files** - Attach contracts and documents from Drive instead of uploading duplicates.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Schedule reminders** - Add invoice due dates and follow-ups to your calendar.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Grant all scopes** - Full integration provides the best experience and most features.
</Tip>
