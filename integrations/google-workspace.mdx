## Overview

Google Workspace integration connects Every with your Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Contacts. Import contacts, send emails through the Agent, attach Drive files, and schedule meetings seamlessly.

**What You Can Do:**
- Import contacts from Google Contacts
- Send emails through Gmail (via Every Agent)
- Create and view calendar events
- Search and attach Google Drive files
- Automate workflows with Google services

## Connecting Google Workspace

### Quick Setup

Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Connect Google Account** → Select your Google account → Review permissions → Click Allow → Return to Every.

**Permissions Requested:**
- **Gmail:** Send emails, read messages
- **Calendar:** Read and write events
- **Drive:** View and search files
- **Contacts:** Read contact information

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Connect Google:
  - "Connect my Google Workspace account"
  - "Set up Google integration"
  - "Link my Gmail to Every"
</Tip>

<Note>
  You can grant partial permissions (e.g., only Contacts). Add more scopes later as needed.
</Note>

### Managing Scopes

Scopes define what Every can access. If a feature requires missing scopes, the app prompts you to reconnect and grant additional permissions.

**To Update:** Settings → Integrations → Reconnect Google → Grant additional permissions

## Gmail Integration

### Sending Emails via Agent

The Every Agent can send emails through your Gmail account:

**How It Works:** Chat with Agent ("Send an email to ACME Corp thanking them for payment") → Agent drafts email → You review → Approve → Sent from your Gmail

**Use Cases:**
- Invoice reminders and thank you messages
- Follow-ups and project updates
- Meeting confirmations
- Custom client communications

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Send emails:
  - "Send invoice INV-123 via Gmail to ACME Corp"
  - "Email a payment reminder to John Smith"
  - "Draft a follow-up email to my client about the proposal"
</Tip>

### Suggested Responses

Agent generates context-aware email suggestions (API: `/api/generate-suggested-messages`). View client message → Generate response → Select from 2-3 options → Customize → Send.

## Google Calendar Integration

### Managing Events

**Via Agent:** "Create a calendar event for my meeting with ACME Corp next Tuesday at 2 PM"

**Features:**
- Meeting title and description
- Date, time, and location
- Attendee invitations
- Reminders and notifications

**Use Cases:**
- Client meeting scheduling
- Invoice due date reminders
- Project milestone tracking
- Follow-up task scheduling

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Schedule meetings:
  - "Schedule a meeting with ACME Corp next Tuesday at 2 PM"
  - "Add a reminder for invoice follow-up on Friday"
  - "Set up a meeting with TechCo to discuss the proposal"
</Tip>

**Calendar integration capabilities:** Fetch upcoming events, view details, create/update events

<Tip>
  Add invoice due dates to your calendar for automatic follow-up reminders!
</Tip>

## Google Drive Integration

### Searching and Attaching Files

**Drive integration capabilities:** Search by filename, file type, recent files, starred files, or specific folders

**Use Cases:**
- Find contracts to attach to invoices
- Locate project files and specifications
- Reference documentation
- Attach proposals and templates

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Search Drive:
  - "Find the ACME Corp contract in my Drive"
  - "Search for project specifications in Google Drive"
  - "Attach the proposal template from Drive"
</Tip>

### Attaching Files

Create/edit invoice or proposal → Click "Attach from Drive" → Search or browse → Select file → Link added → Client can access (based on Drive permissions)

**Supported:** Documents, Spreadsheets, Presentations, Images, PDFs, any file type in Drive

**Permissions:** File access managed in Google Drive. Consider making files public or sharing with client email.

## Google Contacts Integration

### Importing Contacts

**How to capture Google contacts:**
- **Inline suggestions:** Once Google is connected, the Email field in the client form uses the Google Contacts search component. Pick a result to auto-fill the client name, contact person, and phone instantly.
- **Scan Contacts workflow:** Open the **Home** dashboard → **Get Started** card → **Scan Contacts**. Google Contacts Analysis reviews Gmail, Calendar, and Contacts history, then lets you select which suggested contacts to add as clients.

**What's imported:** Name, email, phone, company/organization info, plus any notes returned by the analysis.

**Duplicate Prevention:** Suggestions are filtered by email so existing clients are skipped automatically.

**Refresh cadence:** Scans are on-demand. Re-run **Scan Contacts** (or re-ask the agent) whenever you want fresh suggestions.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Start the analysis from chat:
  - "Scan my Google contacts and add likely clients"
  - "Review Google contacts marked as clients and add them to Every"
  - "Show me Google contacts we haven't imported yet"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Run a scan during onboarding to avoid manual data entry.
</Tip>

### Google Contacts Sync

Every tracks which contacts exist in your team's Google Contacts, helping you identify established relationships.

**How it works:**
- When a contact is created with an email, Every checks if that email exists in any team member's Google Contacts
- A sync indicator badge appears on contacts that match
- Daily background sync at 3 AM UTC keeps the status current
- Manual sync available via API for immediate updates

**Benefits:**
- See at a glance which client contacts are already in your Google ecosystem
- Avoid duplicating contacts you already have relationships with
- Know when colleagues have interacted with a contact before

### Client Enrichment

After a client is created, open their record and click **Enrich Client**. Every Agent uses Gmail, Calendar, Google Contacts, and public web data to enrich the record with company info, additional contacts, and social profiles.

## Every Agent Integration

The Agent leverages Google integrations with the `check_google_services_status` tool to verify connections before using features.

**Agent Capabilities:**
- Send Gmail emails
- Create calendar events
- Search Drive files
- Reference contact data
- Schedule follow-ups and reminders

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "Send invoice reminder to ACME Corp"
Agent: ✓ Checks Gmail connection
       ✓ Drafts professional reminder
       ✓ Sends via your Gmail
       ✓ Logs activity
```

## Managing Connection

### Connection Status

**View Status:** Settings → Integrations → Google Workspace section

**Status Indicators:**
- ✅ Connected
- ⚠️ Needs reconnection
- ❌ Not connected

**Health Info:** Last successful sync, active scopes, token expiration, error messages

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Check Google status:
  - "Check my Google Workspace connection status"
  - "Is Gmail connected?"
  - "What Google permissions do I have enabled?"
</Tip>

### Reconnecting

**When Needed:** Adding new scopes, token expired, connection error, or permission changes

**To Reconnect:** Settings → Integrations → Reconnect Google → Log in → Grant permissions

### Disconnecting

**To Disconnect:** Settings → Integrations → Google Workspace → Disconnect → Confirm

**What Happens:**
- Stored tokens removed
- Features become unavailable
- Historical data preserved (imported clients, past Drive links, email/calendar history)
- Can reconnect anytime

<Warning>
  Disconnecting removes integration features but doesn't delete imported data.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Common problems:** Wrong account selected, pop-up blocked, third-party cookies disabled, organization security policy

**Solutions:** Allow pop-ups for every.ai, enable third-party cookies, try different browser, check organization GSuite settings, or contact IT for corporate accounts

### Feature Not Working

**Check:** Connection status, required scopes granted, token not expired, internet connection

**Solution:** Reconnect Google account, grant missing scopes, refresh page, or contact support

### Service-Specific Issues

**Gmail not sending:** Verify `gmail.send` scope granted, email draft approved, check sent items in Gmail, or reconnect

**Calendar events not creating:** Verify Calendar scope granted, correct calendar selected, valid date/time, or reconnect

**Drive files not found:** Verify Drive scope granted, files exist, accurate search terms, check file permissions, or reconnect

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Import contacts early** - Start by importing Google Contacts to save manual data entry.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use Agent for emails** - Let Agent draft professional emails based on your data.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Link Drive files** - Attach contracts and documents from Drive instead of uploading duplicates.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Schedule reminders** - Add invoice due dates and follow-ups to your calendar.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Grant all scopes** - Full integration provides the best experience and most features.
