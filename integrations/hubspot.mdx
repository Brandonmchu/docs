## Overview

HubSpot integration syncs your CRM contacts and deals into Every. Keep HubSpot as your source of truth while enabling seamless invoicing for HubSpot-managed clients.

**Key Features:**
- One-way sync (HubSpot → Every)
- Import contacts and deals with pipeline data
- HubSpot as source of truth (read-only in Every)
- Duplicate resolution before import
- View deal pipeline in Every

## How HubSpot Integration Works

### One-Way Sync

**Important:** Sync is HubSpot → Every only

Changes in HubSpot sync to Every, but changes in Every do NOT sync back. HubSpot remains the authoritative CRM system, while Every focuses on invoicing.

**Why One-Way:**
- Prevents data conflicts
- Maintains clear system ownership
- HubSpot for CRM, Every for invoicing

<Note>
  HubSpot is your CRM. Every is your invoicing platform. Integration brings them together!
</Note>

### Source Attribution

**Records from HubSpot:**
- Marked with `source = hubspot` badge
- Links to HubSpot record
- Fields are read-only while connected
- When disconnected, records unlock for editing in Every

## Connecting HubSpot

### OAuth Connection

Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Connect HubSpot** → Log in to HubSpot → Select account (if multiple) → Review permissions → Grant Access → Return to Every.

**Permissions Requested:**
- Read contacts and companies
- Read deals and pipeline stages
- View pipeline data

**OAuth API Endpoint:** `/api/hubspot/auth/url`

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Connect HubSpot:
  - "Connect my HubSpot account"
  - "Set up HubSpot integration"
  - "Link my HubSpot CRM to Every"
</Tip>

### Connection Status

**View Status:** Settings → Integrations → HubSpot section

**Status Indicators:**
- ✅ Connected (healthy, operational)
- ⚠️ Needs reconnection (token expired or permissions changed)
- ❌ Not connected
- Last sync time and sync health

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Check HubSpot status:
  - "Check my HubSpot connection status"
  - "When was the last HubSpot sync?"
  - "Show me HubSpot sync status"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Check integration status weekly to ensure sync is working properly!
</Tip>

## Syncing Data

### Initial Sync

**First Connection:** Navigate to HubSpot Sync dialog → Review contacts to import → Resolve duplicates → Select contacts → Click Import Selected → Wait for completion → Contacts appear in Every

**What Syncs:**
- Contact names, emails, phones
- Company names and addresses
- Deal information and pipeline stages
- Deal amounts and close dates

### Ongoing Sync

**Automatic:** Runs periodically (configurable schedule), syncing new contacts, updating existing contacts, and importing new deals

**Manual:** Settings → Integrations → HubSpot → Sync Now

**Last Sync Time:** Shown in HubSpot section to indicate data freshness

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Sync HubSpot:
  - "Sync my HubSpot contacts"
  - "Import contacts from HubSpot"
  - "Run a HubSpot sync now"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Set up automatic daily sync to keep data fresh without manual intervention!
</Tip>

### Duplicate Resolution

**Before Import:** System checks for existing clients by email and shows potential duplicates

**Duplicate Options:**
- **Replace:** Update existing Every record with HubSpot data
- **Skip:** Keep Every record, don't import this HubSpot contact
- **Create New:** Import as separate client (not recommended)

**Best Practice:** Choose "Replace" if HubSpot data is more current, "Skip" if Every has important data not in HubSpot

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Handle duplicates:
  - "Show me HubSpot duplicate contacts"
  - "Help me resolve HubSpot duplicates"
  - "Check for duplicate contacts before importing"
</Tip>

<Warning>
  "Replace" overwrites Every data with HubSpot data. Choose carefully!
</Warning>

## HubSpot Contacts in Every

### Contact Display

**HubSpot Badge:** Contacts from HubSpot show badge linking to HubSpot record

**Read-Only While Connected:** Cannot edit HubSpot-sourced fields to prevent conflicts. Edit in HubSpot and sync to Every.

**Editable Fields:** Every-specific data (invoices, payments, notes) is always editable and not synced back

### Using HubSpot Contacts

**Full Integration:** Invoice HubSpot contacts, track payments, send proposals, view activity history - all Every features available

**Data Flow:**
```
HubSpot Contact Info → Every Client
    ↓
Create Invoice in Every
    ↓
Send to Client
    ↓
Track Payment
    ↓
(Payment data stays in Every)
```

## HubSpot Deals & Pipeline

### Deal Sync

**Deals Import:** HubSpot deals sync with associated contacts, including deal stage, amount, close date, and pipeline status

**Deal Information:**
- Deal name and amount
- Stage (Qualified Lead, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, Won, Lost)
- Expected close date
- Associated contact and deal owner

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** View HubSpot deals:
  - "Show me my HubSpot deals"
  - "What deals are in the pipeline?"
  - "Which HubSpot deals need invoices?"
  - "List all won deals from HubSpot"
</Tip>

### Client Pipeline View

**Access:** Navigate to **Clients** → **Pipeline View** to see all clients with active deals, stages, and amounts

**Pipeline Features:**
- Visual deal stages and progression
- Deal amounts and status
- HubSpot badge on synced deals
- Quick invoice creation from deal

**Example:**
```
Prospecting: 5 deals, $50,000
Proposal Sent: 3 deals, $35,000
Negotiation: 2 deals, $25,000
Won: 1 deal, $15,000
```

<Tip>
  Use pipeline view to identify which deals need proposals or invoices!
</Tip>

## Managing HubSpot Integration

### Monitoring Sync Status

**Status Page:** `/api/hubspot/status`

**Sync Health:** Connection status, last successful sync, sync frequency, error messages, records synced count

**Live Progress:** Sync in progress indicator, progress percentage, records processed, ETA to completion

**Sync History:** View past syncs with success/failure status, records synced per run, and error logs

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Monitor sync:
  - "Show me HubSpot sync history"
  - "Are there any HubSpot sync errors?"
  - "How many contacts were synced from HubSpot?"
</Tip>

### Troubleshooting Sync

**Common Issues:** Token expired (reconnect), permission changes (reauthorize), network errors (retry), duplicate conflicts (resolve), or rate limits (wait and retry)

**Solutions:** Follow error message instructions, reconnect if prompted, or contact support with error details

### Disconnecting HubSpot

**To Disconnect:** Settings → Integrations → HubSpot → Disconnect → Confirm

**What Happens:**
- OAuth tokens removed, sync stops
- HubSpot-sourced records unlocked for editing
- No data deleted (all imported contacts and deals remain)
- Badge removed from contacts
- Can still invoice clients

<Warning>
  Disconnecting doesn't delete data, but you lose automatic updates from HubSpot!
</Warning>

## HubSpot Sync Dialog

**Business Context Workspace Integration:** HubSpot sync accessible from global chat dialog with full functionality

**Features:**
- View sync status and manually trigger sync
- Monitor real-time progress
- Resolve duplicates
- Review imported records

### Sync Configuration

**Configurable Settings:**
- Sync frequency (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Auto-resolve duplicates (replace or skip)
- Selective sync (specific HubSpot lists)
- Field mapping customization

## Common Workflows

### Initial Setup

**Day 1:** Connect HubSpot → Review contacts in sync dialog → Resolve duplicates → Import all active contacts → Verify import successful

**Ongoing:** Deal closes in HubSpot ("Won") → Sync brings contact and deal to Every → Create invoice for new client → Send invoice → Track payment (stays in Every)

### Weekly Pipeline Review

Check HubSpot sync status → View pipeline in Every → Identify "Won" deals needing invoices → Create invoices for new wins → Monitor proposal-stage deals → Follow up as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Not Running

**Check:** Connection status (needs reconnection?), internet connectivity, HubSpot service status, last sync time

**Solution:** Reconnect HubSpot, manually trigger sync, wait for automatic sync, or contact support

### Contacts Not Appearing

**Verify:** Contacts exist in HubSpot, not filtered out (active vs inactive), sync completed successfully, no duplicate skip

**Solution:** Check HubSpot for contact, review sync log, re-run sync, or check duplicate resolution choices

### Can't Edit HubSpot Contact

**Reason:** HubSpot is source of truth while connected

**Solution:** Edit in HubSpot (will sync to Every), or disconnect HubSpot (unlocks for editing). Every-specific data (invoices) is always editable.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Keep HubSpot data clean** - Clean CRM data syncs clean to Every.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Resolve duplicates carefully** - Review each duplicate before choosing replace or skip.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Monitor sync status** - Check weekly to ensure sync is working correctly.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use for pipeline visibility** - Leverage deal sync to see which clients need invoices.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Edit in HubSpot** - Make contact changes in HubSpot so they sync properly.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Set up automatic sync** - Daily sync keeps data fresh without manual work.
</Tip>
