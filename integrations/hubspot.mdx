## Overview

HubSpot integration connects Every Agent to your HubSpot CRM, enabling conversational access to your contacts, companies, and deals. Instead of switching between apps, ask Every Agent to look up CRM data, search contacts, and view deal pipeline information.

**Key Features:**
- Search and view HubSpot contacts and companies
- Access deal information and pipeline stages
- Manage CRM objects through natural conversation
- Secure OAuth connection with fine-grained permissions

<Note>
  HubSpot integration is **agent-powered** - you interact with HubSpot data conversationally through Every Agent, not through direct UI sync. This gives you flexible, on-demand access to your CRM data.
</Note>

## How HubSpot Integration Works

### Agent-Powered Access

Every Agent connects directly to HubSpot's API, giving you conversational access to your CRM:

```
You: "Find my contact at Acme Corp"
Agent: "I found John Smith at Acme Corp. Email: john@acme.com, Phone: 555-0100.
       They have an open deal 'Website Redesign' worth $25,000 in the Proposal stage."

You: "What deals do I have closing this month?"
Agent: "You have 3 deals closing in January:
       - Acme Corp Website Redesign: $25,000 (Proposal)
       - TechStart Consulting: $15,000 (Negotiation)
       - Beta Inc Support Contract: $8,500 (Closing)"
```

### What You Can Access

**Contacts:**
- Search by name, email, or company
- View contact details and properties
- See associated companies and deals

**Companies:**
- Look up company information
- View company properties and contacts
- Check related deals and activities

**Deals:**
- Search deals by name or stage
- View deal amounts and close dates
- See pipeline progression
- Check associated contacts

## Connecting HubSpot

### OAuth Connection

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Find HubSpot in the list of available integrations
3. Click **Connect**
4. Log in to your HubSpot account
5. Review and approve the requested permissions
6. You'll be redirected back to Every with connection confirmed

**Permissions Requested:**
- Read contacts and contact properties
- Write contacts (for updates via agent)
- Read companies and company properties
- Write companies
- Read deals and deal properties
- Read deal schemas (pipeline stages)

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** After connecting, verify access:
  - "Search for a contact in HubSpot"
  - "Show me my HubSpot deals"
  - "Look up [company name] in HubSpot"
</Tip>

### Connection Status

**View Status:** Settings → Integrations → HubSpot

**Status Indicators:**
- ✅ Connected - Integration active and working
- ⚠️ Needs reconnection - Token expired, click to reconnect
- ❌ Not connected - Integration not set up

## Using HubSpot with Every Agent

### Search Contacts

```
"Find contacts at Acme Corp"
"Search for john@example.com in HubSpot"
"Look up Sarah Johnson in my CRM"
```

### View Deals

```
"Show me all deals in the Proposal stage"
"What deals are closing this quarter?"
"Find deals worth over $10,000"
```

### Check Companies

```
"Look up TechStart Inc in HubSpot"
"What contacts do I have at Beta Corp?"
"Show me company details for Acme"
```

### Pipeline Overview

```
"What's my deal pipeline look like?"
"How much revenue is in negotiation stage?"
"Which deals need follow-up?"
```

## Managing the Integration

### Refreshing Connection

If your HubSpot connection expires:

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click **Reconnect** on HubSpot
3. Log in to HubSpot again
4. Approve permissions
5. Connection restored

<Tip>
  HubSpot tokens refresh automatically. You typically only need to reconnect if you change HubSpot permissions or revoke app access.
</Tip>

### Disconnecting HubSpot

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Find HubSpot → Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm disconnection

**What happens:**
- Every Agent loses HubSpot access
- No data is deleted from either system
- You can reconnect anytime

## Common Workflows

### Client Lookup Before Invoice

```
You: "I need to invoice Acme Corp. Can you find their details in HubSpot?"

Agent: "I found Acme Corp in HubSpot:
       - Primary Contact: John Smith (john@acme.com)
       - Deal: Website Redesign ($25,000) - marked as Won

       Would you like me to create an invoice for this project?"
```

### Deal Pipeline Review

```
You: "Give me a summary of my sales pipeline"

Agent: "Your HubSpot pipeline summary:
       - Prospecting: 5 deals ($45,000)
       - Proposal: 3 deals ($35,000)
       - Negotiation: 2 deals ($28,000)
       - Closing: 1 deal ($12,000)

       Total pipeline value: $120,000"
```

### Contact Research

```
You: "I'm meeting with TechStart tomorrow. What do I know about them?"

Agent: "TechStart Inc from HubSpot:
       - Industry: Software
       - Contacts: Sarah Chen (CEO), Mike Park (CTO)
       - Active Deal: Platform Integration ($18,000) in Proposal stage
       - Last Activity: Email sent 3 days ago"
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Keep HubSpot data clean** - Every Agent retrieves what's in HubSpot, so accurate CRM data means accurate agent responses.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use for context, not sync** - HubSpot integration is for lookups and queries, not automatic data sync. Invoice in Every, manage CRM in HubSpot.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Be specific in queries** - "Find John at Acme" works better than "find my contact" when you have many contacts.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "HubSpot not connected" error

**Solution:** Go to Settings → Integrations → Reconnect HubSpot

### "Contact not found"

**Possible causes:**
- Contact doesn't exist in HubSpot
- Different spelling or email
- HubSpot permissions don't include this contact

**Solution:** Verify contact exists in HubSpot directly, check spelling

### "Permission denied"

**Solution:** Reconnect HubSpot and ensure you approve all requested permissions during OAuth

### Agent can't access deals

**Check:** Your HubSpot user account has deals access and deal permissions were approved during connection
