## Overview

HubSpot integration syncs your CRM contacts and deals into Every AI. Keep HubSpot as your source of truth while enabling seamless invoicing for HubSpot-managed clients.

**Key Features:**
- One-way sync (HubSpot → Every AI)
- Import contacts and deals
- View deal pipeline in Every AI
- HubSpot as source of truth
- Duplicate resolution before import
- Connection status monitoring

## How HubSpot Integration Works

### One-Way Sync

**Important:** Sync is HubSpot → Every AI only

**What This Means:**
- Changes in HubSpot sync to Every AI
- Changes in Every AI do NOT sync back to HubSpot
- HubSpot remains authoritative source
- Every AI is read-only for HubSpot data

**Why One-Way:**
- Prevents data conflicts
- Maintains HubSpot as CRM system
- Every AI focuses on invoicing
- Clear data ownership

<Note>
  HubSpot is your CRM. Every AI is your invoicing platform. Integration brings them together!
</Note>

### Source Attribution

**Records from HubSpot:**
- Marked with `source = hubspot`
- Badge shows HubSpot origin
- Links to HubSpot record
- While connected, fields are read-only

**When Disconnected:**
- HubSpot records unlock for editing
- Can modify in Every AI
- No longer synced with HubSpot
- Become native Every AI records

## Connecting HubSpot

### OAuth Connection Flow

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Integrations**

9. Return to Every AI
10. Connection established!

**Permissions Requested:**

</Tip>

## Syncing Data

### Initial Sync

**First Sync:**
1. Connect HubSpot account
2. Navigate to **HubSpot Sync** dialog
3. Review contacts to import
4. Resolve duplicates (see below)
5. Select contacts to sync
6. Click **Import Selected**
7. Wait for sync to complete
8. Contacts appear in Every AI

**What Syncs:**
- Contact names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Company names
- Addresses
- Deal information
- Pipeline stages

### Ongoing Sync

**Automatic Sync:**
- Runs periodically (schedule configurable)
- Syncs new contacts
- Updates existing contacts
- Imports new deals
- Updates deal stages

**Manual Sync:**
1. Settings → Integrations → HubSpot
2. Click **Sync Now**
3. Sync runs immediately
4. View progress indicators
5. Completion notification

**Last Sync Time:**

</Tip>

### Duplicate Resolution

**Before Import:**
- System checks for existing clients
- Matches by email address
- Shows potential duplicates

**Duplicate Dialog:**
- Lists each duplicate found
- Shows HubSpot record vs Every AI record
- Options:
  - **Replace**: Update existing Every AI record with HubSpot data
  - **Skip**: Keep Every AI record, don't import this HubSpot contact
  - **Create New**: Import as separate client (not recommended)

**Best Practice:**
- Review each duplicate carefully
- Choose "Replace" if HubSpot data is more current
- Choose "Skip" if Every AI has important data not in HubSpot

<Warning>
  "Replace" overwrites Every AI data with HubSpot data. Choose carefully!
</Warning>

3. Resolve duplicates (choose strategy)
4. Import all active contacts

1. Deal closes in HubSpot (moves to "Won")
2. Sync brings contact and deal to Every AI
3. Create invoice for new client
4. Send invoice
5. Track payment
6. Payment doesn't sync back to HubSpot (manual update)

### Managing Sales Pipeline

**Weekly Review:**

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Not Running

**Check:**
- Connection status (needs reconnection?)
- Internet connectivity
- HubSpot service status
- Last sync time

**Solution:**
- Reconnect HubSpot
- Manually trigger sync
- Wait for automatic sync
- Contact support if persists

- Sync completed successfully
- No duplicate skip

**Solution:**

- Or disconnect HubSpot (unlocks for editing)
- Every AI-specific data (invoices) always editable

### Sync Errors

**Common Errors:**
- Rate limit exceeded (wait and retry)

- Invalid data (check HubSpot records)

**Resolution:**
