## Overview

Granola integration connects Every Agent to your Granola meeting notes, enabling conversational access to meeting transcripts, notes, and insights. Instead of manually searching through past meetings, ask Every Agent to find what was discussed, pull action items, or reference meeting context.

**Key Features:**
- Search and browse your Granola meeting notes
- Retrieve meeting content including notes, summaries, and attendees
- Pull full meeting transcripts (paid Granola tiers)
- Chat with Granola to ask questions about your meetings
- Use meeting context to inform follow-ups, invoices, and proposals

<Note>
  Granola integration is **agent-powered** - you interact with meeting data conversationally through Every Agent. This gives you flexible, on-demand access to everything discussed in your calls.
</Note>

## How Granola Integration Works

### Agent-Powered Meeting Access

Every Agent connects directly to Granola, giving you conversational access to your meeting notes:

```
You: "What meetings did I have with Sam last week?"
Agent: "I found 3 meetings with Sam last week:
       - Monday: Project Kickoff (Sam, Lisa, Mike)
       - Wednesday: Design Review (Sam, You)
       - Friday: Sprint Planning (Sam, Team)"

You: "What were the action items from the Design Review?"
Agent: "From your Design Review with Sam on Wednesday:
       - Sam: Finalize mockups by Friday
       - You: Send updated brand guidelines
       - Both: Review competitor analysis before next meeting"
```

## Common Workflows

### Meeting Follow-Up

```
You: "Summarize my meeting with Acme Corp from this morning and draft a follow-up email"

Agent: "From your meeting with Acme Corp (John Smith, Sarah Lee):
       - Discussed Q2 consulting engagement
       - Budget approved at $15,000/month
       - Start date: March 1st
       - Action items: You send SOW by Friday

       Here's a draft follow-up email:

       Subject: Great Meeting - Next Steps for Q2 Engagement
       Hi John and Sarah, thank you for meeting today..."
```

### Invoice from Meeting Context

```
You: "Check my meeting notes with TechStart from last week and create an invoice for the work discussed"

Agent: "From your meeting with TechStart on Thursday:
       - Approved: 40 hours of development at $150/hr
       - Plus: $2,000 infrastructure setup fee

       I'll create an invoice:
       - TechStart Inc
       - Development Services: 40 hrs @ $150/hr = $6,000
       - Infrastructure Setup: $2,000
       - Total: $8,000

       Should I create this invoice?"
```

### Prep for Recurring Meetings

```
You: "What did we cover in last week's standup with the design team?"

Agent: "Last week's design standup covered:
       - Homepage redesign: mockups approved, moving to development
       - Mobile nav: still blocked on icon library decision
       - Client feedback: positive on color palette, wants font changes

       Open items for this week:
       - Finalize icon library choice
       - Implement font changes from client feedback"
```

## Managing the Integration

### Refreshing Connection

If your Granola connection expires:

1. Go to Settings > Integrations
2. Click **Reconnect** on Granola
3. Log in to Granola again
4. Authorize access
5. Connection restored

<Tip>
  Granola tokens refresh automatically. You typically only need to reconnect if you revoke app access in your Granola account settings.
</Tip>

### Disconnecting Granola

1. Go to Settings > Integrations
2. Find Granola > Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm disconnection

**What happens:** Every Agent loses access to Granola meeting notes. No data is deleted from either system. You can reconnect anytime.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Use for meeting follow-ups** - Ask Every Agent to summarize meetings and draft follow-up emails or action item lists right after your calls.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Reference meetings in invoices** - When creating invoices, ask Every Agent to pull meeting context for accurate line items and descriptions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Be specific with dates and names** - "What did Sam say in Tuesday's meeting?" works better than "What was discussed recently?" when you have many meetings.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Combine with other integrations** - Use Granola meeting context alongside HubSpot CRM data or Xero accounting for comprehensive client management.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "Granola not connected" error

**Solution:** Go to Settings > Integrations > Reconnect Granola

### "Meeting not found"

**Possible causes:**
- Meeting was not recorded in Granola
- Different search terms than the meeting title
- Meeting is in a different Granola workspace

**Solution:** Try searching by date or attendee name instead of meeting title

### "Transcript not available"

**Possible causes:**
- Your Granola plan doesn't include transcript access
- The meeting was not transcribed

**Solution:** Upgrade your Granola plan for transcript access, or use meeting notes and summaries which are available on all plans

### Agent can't find recent meetings

**Check:** Verify your Granola connection is active in Settings > Integrations. If status shows expired, click Reconnect.
