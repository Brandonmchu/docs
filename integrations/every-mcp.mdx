## Overview

Every MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets you connect AI coding assistants directly to your Every business data. Query invoices, clients, expenses, and more from within your development environment using natural language.

**Why Use Every MCP:**
- Access business data without leaving your IDE
- Natural language queries for invoices, clients, expenses
- Create invoices and record expenses through AI assistants
- Secure OAuth authentication via your Every account

## Supported AI Assistants

Every MCP works with any AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol:

- **Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI tool)
- **ChatGPT** (via MCP plugin)
- **Cursor** (AI-powered code editor)
- **Other MCP-compatible clients**

## Setting Up Claude Code

### Quick Setup

Run this single command to add Every MCP to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add every-mcp --transport http --url https://every-mcp-server-production.up.railway.app/mcp
```

### First-Time Authentication

When you first use an Every tool, Claude Code will prompt you to authenticate:

1. A browser window opens to Every's login page
2. Sign in with your Every account
3. Authorize Claude Code to access your data
4. Return to your terminal - you're connected!

<Note>
  Authentication uses secure OAuth. Your credentials are never stored by Claude Code - only a secure token that can be revoked anytime.
</Note>

### Verify Connection

After setup, verify the connection by asking Claude:

```
"List my recent invoices"
```

If connected successfully, Claude will query your Every data and show results.

## What You Can Do

### Invoices

<Tip>
  For complex multi-step tasks, use `send_message` to leverage Every Agent's full capabilities within your AI assistant.
</Tip>

## Natural Language Queries

Every MCP understands natural language. You don't need to learn specific commands:

```
"What invoices are overdue?"
"How much did ACME Corp pay me last year?"
"Show expenses I can bill back to clients"
"Create an invoice for last week's consulting work"
```

The AI assistant translates your request into the appropriate tool calls automatically.

## Security

### Authentication

- **OAuth 2.0:** Industry-standard secure authentication
- **Token-based:** No passwords stored locally
- **Revocable:** Disconnect anytime from Every settings

### Data Access

- **Read/Write:** Full access to your Every data based on your permissions
- **Organization-scoped:** Only access data from organizations you belong to
- **Audit trail:** All actions logged in Every's activity history

### Revoking Access

To disconnect an AI assistant:

1. Go to **Every** → **Settings** → **Connected Apps**
2. Find the AI assistant connection
3. Click **Revoke Access**

<Warning>
  Revoking access immediately invalidates the connection. You'll need to re-authenticate to use Every MCP again.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**"Authentication failed":** Your token may have expired. Remove and re-add the MCP connection:

```bash
claude mcp remove every-mcp
claude mcp add every-mcp --transport http --url https://every-mcp-server-production.up.railway.app/mcp
```

**"Tool not found":** Ensure you're using the correct MCP URL. The production URL is:
```
https://every-mcp-server-production.up.railway.app/mcp
```

**"Permission denied":** Check that your Every account has access to the organization's data you're querying.

### Data Not Showing

**No results returned:** Verify the data exists in Every. Try the same query in the Every web app.

**Wrong organization:** If you belong to multiple organizations, specify which one in your query: "Show invoices for [Organization Name]"

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Be specific with queries** - "Show unpaid invoices over $1,000 from the last 30 days" returns better results than "show invoices"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use filters** - Take advantage of status, date range, and client filters to narrow results
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Verify before sending** - Always review invoices and emails before asking the AI to send them to clients
</Tip>
