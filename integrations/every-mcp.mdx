## Overview

Every MCP (Model Context Protocol) connects AI coding assistants directly to your Every business data. Query invoices, clients, expenses, and more from within your development environment using natural language.

**Why Use Every MCP:**
- Access business data without leaving your IDE
- Natural language queries for all Every features
- Create invoices and record expenses through AI assistants
- Secure OAuth authentication

## Supported AI Assistants

Every MCP works with any AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol:

- **Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI tool)
- **ChatGPT** (via MCP plugin)
- **Cursor** (AI-powered code editor)
- **Other MCP-compatible clients**

## Setup Instructions

**MCP Server URL:** `https://every-mcp-server-production.up.railway.app/mcp`

### Claude Code

**Step 1: Add the MCP server**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http every-mcp https://every-mcp-server-production.up.railway.app/mcp
```

**Step 2: Authenticate**

After adding, the server shows as "failed" until you authenticate:

1. Type `/mcp` in Claude Code to open the MCP manager
2. Select **every-mcp** from the list
3. Click **Authenticate** - your browser opens to Every's sign-in page
4. Sign in to your Every account and authorize access
5. Return to Claude Code - the server should now show as connected

<Tip>
  If authentication doesn't start automatically, try asking Claude to use an Every tool (e.g., "list my invoices") - this triggers the OAuth flow.
</Tip>

**Step 3: Verify**

Ask Claude: "List my recent invoices"

### Cursor

Add to your MCP configuration file (`.cursor/mcp.json` for project-specific, or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for global):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "every-mcp": {
      "url": "https://every-mcp-server-production.up.railway.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor and switch to **Agent Mode** (not Ask Mode) to access MCP tools.

<Note>
  Cursor supports up to 40 tools from MCP servers. Every MCP provides 18 tools, well within this limit.
</Note>

### ChatGPT

ChatGPT supports MCP via Developer Mode (Pro and Plus users):

1. Go to **Settings** → **Connectors** → **Advanced** → **Developer Mode**
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Add a new MCP connector with URL: `https://every-mcp-server-production.up.railway.app/mcp`
4. Authenticate with your Every account when prompted

Access Every tools through the Developer Mode menu in your chat.

<Note>
  ChatGPT requires remote MCP servers (localhost not supported). Every MCP is hosted remotely, so it works out of the box.
</Note>

### Other MCP Clients

For any MCP-compatible client, use:
- **URL:** `https://every-mcp-server-production.up.railway.app/mcp`
- **Transport:** HTTP (Streamable HTTP / SSE)
- **Auth:** OAuth 2.0 (prompted on first use)

<Note>
  Authentication uses secure OAuth. Your credentials are never stored locally - only a secure token that can be revoked anytime from Every settings.
</Note>

## What You Can Do

Every MCP provides 18 tools covering all major Every features.

### Invoices

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_invoices` | Search and filter by status, client, date range |
| `view_invoice` | Get full details of a specific invoice |
| `create_invoice` | Create new invoices with line items |
| `update_invoice` | Modify existing invoices |

</Tip>

## Security

**Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 industry-standard, token-based (no passwords stored locally), revocable anytime

**Data Access:** Read/Write based on your permissions, organization-scoped, all actions logged in activity history

### Revoking Access

Go to **Every** → **Settings** → **Connected Apps** → Find the AI assistant → Click **Revoke Access**

<Warning>
  Revoking access immediately invalidates the connection. Re-authentication required to use Every MCP again.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Server shows "failed" in `/mcp`:** This is normal before authentication. Select the server and click **Authenticate** to sign in via OAuth.

**"Authentication failed":** Token may have expired. Re-authenticate:
- **Claude Code:** `claude mcp remove every-mcp` then re-add
- **Cursor:** Delete and re-add the entry in `mcp.json`, restart Cursor
- **ChatGPT:** Remove and re-add the connector in Developer Mode settings

**"Tool not found":** Verify MCP URL is exactly: `https://every-mcp-server-production.up.railway.app/mcp`

**"Permission denied":** Check that your Every account has access to the organization you're querying.

**Cursor not showing tools:** Ensure you're in **Agent Mode**, not Ask Mode. MCP tools only work in Agent Mode.

### Data Not Showing

**No results:** Verify data exists in Every web app first.

**Wrong organization:** Specify which organization in your query: "Show invoices for [Organization Name]"

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Be specific with queries** - "Show unpaid invoices over $1,000 from the last 30 days" returns better results than "show invoices"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Verify before sending** - Always review invoices and emails before asking the AI to send them to clients
</Tip>
