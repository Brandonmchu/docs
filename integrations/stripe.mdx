**Why Use Stripe:**
- Clients pay 5-10x faster with instant payment
- Automatic payment tracking and invoice updates
- Secure, professional payment experience
- Standard industry rates (2.9% + $0.30)

## Connecting Stripe

### Quick Setup

Go to **Settings** → **Payments** → **Connect Stripe Account** → Choose to create new or connect existing Stripe account → Complete verification → Return to Every.

**What You Need:**
- Business information (name, address, tax ID)
- Bank account details for payouts
- Government ID for verification

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Connect Stripe:
  - "Connect my Stripe account"
  - "Set up online payments for invoices"
  - "How do I enable Stripe integration?"
</Tip>

<Note>
  You can start accepting payments during verification. Full setup takes 10 minutes; verification completes in 1-3 business days.
</Note>

### Account Status

**Enabled:** Fully operational, accept payments and receive payouts

**Payouts Disabled:** Accept payments but payouts on hold (complete bank setup/verification)

**Restricted:** Account under review (check Stripe dashboard)

**Not Connected:** No integration active

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Check status:
  - "What's my Stripe account status?"
  - "Check if Stripe is connected"
</Tip>

## Using Stripe Payments

### Enabling Online Payments

Online payments are enabled by default on new invoices. Clients see a "Pay Now" button with secure Stripe payment form showing accepted card types.

**To toggle:** Edit invoice → Toggle "Enable Online Payments" → Save

### Payment Process

**Client:** Opens invoice link → Reviews details → Clicks Pay Now → Enters card info → Payment processes instantly → Receives confirmation and email receipt

**You:** Receive instant notification → Invoice auto-updates to Paid → Payment record created → Funds added to Stripe balance

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Track payments:
  - "Check the status of payment for invoice INV-123"
  - "Show me all Stripe payments this month"
  - "Has ACME Corp paid their invoice?"
</Tip>

**Supported Cards:** Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and other major cards

## Fees & Payouts

### Processing Fees

**US & Canada:** 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

**Example:** $1,000 invoice = $29.30 fee, you receive $970.70

Fees are automatically deducted and are tax-deductible business expenses. View detailed fees in Stripe Dashboard → Payments.

<Tip>
  Factor processing fees into your pricing. Most businesses add 3% to rates to cover fees.
</Tip>

### Payouts

**How It Works:** Client pays → Funds collect in Stripe balance → Automatic payout to your bank → Arrives in 2-7 business days

**Schedule:** Daily automatic (default), or configure weekly/monthly in Stripe

**First Payout:** 7-14 days (verification period)

**Manage:** Log in to Stripe → Settings → Bank accounts and scheduling

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Review payouts:
  - "Show me my Stripe payouts this month"
  - "When is my next payout?"
  - "What's my current Stripe balance?"
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Verify bank account details carefully. Incorrect numbers delay payouts!
</Warning>

## Stripe Dashboard

Access via Settings → Payments → View Stripe Dashboard (or directly at stripe.com)

**Key Sections:**
- **Home:** Payment volume, balance, recent activity
- **Payments:** All transactions, refunds, search/filter
- **Balance:** Current balance, pending/completed payouts
- **Reports:** Revenue, fees, reconciliation, tax documents
- **Settings:** Bank accounts, business details, security

<Tip>
  Check Stripe Dashboard weekly to monitor payment activity and payouts!
</Tip>

## Refunds & Disputes

### Processing Refunds

**In Stripe Dashboard:** Find payment → Click Refund Payment → Enter amount (full or partial) → Add reason → Confirm

**Important:**
- Stripe fees are NOT refunded to you
- Refunds take 5-10 business days to reach client
- Every invoice NOT automatically updated (void invoice or add note manually)

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Process refunds:
  - "Process a refund for ACME Corp's last payment"
  - "Issue a partial refund of $500 for TechCo"
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Refunds don't update Every invoices automatically. Void invoice or add note about refund.
</Warning>

### Disputes & Chargebacks

**If disputed:** Stripe notifies you via email → You have 7-14 days to respond → Upload evidence (invoice, delivery confirmation, correspondence) → Stripe adjudicates

**Outcomes:** Win (funds returned to you), Lose (funds returned to client + chargeback fee), or Partial refund

<Tip>
  Keep records of all client communications and deliverables to prevent disputes!
</Tip>

## Security & Compliance

**PCI Compliance:** Automatic! Stripe handles all card data, no card details stored on Every servers.

**Security Features:**
- HTTPS encryption
- Stripe-hosted payment forms (no card data exposure)
- Secure token-based integration
- Two-factor authentication available
- Stripe Radar fraud detection

**Best Practices:**
- Verify large or unusual payments
- Contact client if payment flagged
- Document all work and deliverables
- Use clear service descriptions on invoices

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Issues

**Client can't complete payment:** Insufficient funds, declined card, incorrect details, or fraud flag → Ask client to contact bank or try different card

**Payout not received:** Check Stripe Dashboard for payout status, verify bank details, wait full 2-7 business days, or contact Stripe support

**Connection lost:** Settings → Payments → Reconnect Stripe → Log in and reauthorize

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Enable online payments on all invoices** - Give clients the fastest payment option!
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Respond to disputes quickly** - You only have 7-14 days. Gather evidence immediately.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Complete verification** - Full verification prevents payout delays and increases limits.
</Tip>
