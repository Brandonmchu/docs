## How Xero Integration Works

### Agent-Powered Accounting

Every Agent connects directly to Xero's API with comprehensive accounting capabilities:

```
You: "Create an invoice in Xero for Acme Corp, $5,000 for consulting services"
Agent: "I've created invoice INV-0042 in Xero:
       - Contact: Acme Corp
       - Amount: $5,000.00
       - Description: Consulting services
       - Due Date: Feb 28, 2026

       The invoice is saved as a draft in Xero."

You: "Show me my profit and loss for last quarter"
Agent: "Xero P&L Report (Q4 2025):
       Revenue: $125,000
       Cost of Sales: $45,000
       Gross Profit: $80,000

## Export to Xero Format

Even without the live Xero integration, you can export Every invoices in Xero-compatible CSV format:

1. Go to **Data** → **Export**
2. Select **Invoices**
3. Choose **Xero** format
4. Set date range
5. Download CSV
6. Import into Xero: Business → Invoices → Import

**Xero CSV format includes:**
- ContactName (required)
- InvoiceNumber (required)
- InvoiceDate (DD/MM/YYYY)
- DueDate (DD/MM/YYYY)
- Description
- Quantity
- UnitAmount
- AccountCode
- TaxType

<Tip>
  Use CSV export when you want to batch-import historical invoices or when you prefer manual control over what gets pushed to Xero.
</Tip>

## Managing the Integration

### Refreshing Connection

If your Xero connection expires:

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click **Reconnect** on Xero
3. Log in to Xero
4. Select your organization
5. Approve permissions
6. Connection restored

<Tip>
  Xero tokens refresh automatically. You typically only need to reconnect if you revoke app access in Xero or change organizations.
</Tip>

### Disconnecting Xero

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Find Xero → Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm disconnection

**What happens:** Every Agent loses access to Xero. No data is deleted from either system. You can reconnect anytime.

## Common Workflows

### Create and Send Invoice

```
You: "Create an invoice in Xero for Acme Corp for the Q1 consulting project"

Agent: "I'll create a Xero invoice:
       - Contact: Acme Corp
       - Description: Q1 Consulting Project
       - Amount: Based on your time entries, 45 hours at $175/hr = $7,875

       Should I create this invoice as a draft or approved in Xero?"

You: "Approved"

Agent: "Invoice INV-0043 created in Xero as Approved.
       Acme Corp will receive the invoice at their registered email."
```

### Monthly Financial Review

```
You: "Give me a financial summary from Xero for last month"

Agent: "January 2026 Summary from Xero:

       Revenue: $45,000
       Expenses: $28,000
       Net Profit: $17,000

       Outstanding Invoices: 8 ($32,500)
       Overdue: 2 ($7,200)

       Top clients by revenue:
       1. Acme Corp - $15,000
       2. TechStart - $12,000
       3. Beta Inc - $8,000"
```

### Record Client Payment

```
You: "Acme Corp paid their invoice INV-0038"

Agent: "I found invoice INV-0038 in Xero for Acme Corp, amount $5,000.

       Recording full payment of $5,000...

       Payment recorded. Invoice INV-0038 is now marked as Paid in Xero."
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Use Xero as source of truth** - Treat Xero as your accounting system of record. Create invoices directly in Xero via Every Agent or use CSV export.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review before approving** - When creating invoices via Every Agent, review the details before approving. Draft invoices can be edited in Xero.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Check permissions** - Ensure your Xero user has the necessary permissions for actions you want Every Agent to perform.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "Xero not connected" error

**Solution:** Go to Settings → Integrations → Reconnect Xero

### "Contact not found in Xero"

**Possible causes:**
- Contact doesn't exist in Xero
- Different spelling than in Every
- Contact was archived in Xero

**Solution:** Create the contact in Xero first, or ask agent to create it: "Create a new contact in Xero for [name]"

### "Permission denied"

**Solution:** Reconnect Xero and ensure you approve all requested permissions. Check that your Xero user role has necessary permissions.

### Invoice creation fails

**Check:**
- Contact exists in Xero
- Account codes are valid
- Tax rates are configured
- Required fields are provided

### Reports not loading

**Possible causes:**
- Large data volume (report may take time)
- Date range too broad
- Xero organization access issue

**Solution:** Try a narrower date range, or check Xero directly to verify data access
