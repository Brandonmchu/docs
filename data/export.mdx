## Troubleshooting

**Export shows 0 rows:**
- Check date range includes your data
- Verify status filters aren't excluding everything
- Ensure you have data in the system for that period

**Wrong date format in accounting software:**
- Use the correct preset for your platform
- QuickBooks: MM/DD/YYYY
- Xero: DD/MM/YYYY
- Wave/Custom: YYYY-MM-DD

**Import fails in accounting software:**
- Verify column headers match exactly
- Check for special characters in data
- Ensure amounts don't include currency symbols
- Review the platform's specific import requirements

**Missing client names:**
- Some exports require client names to match existing records
- For Xero: Contact names must match exactly

**Large export is slow:**
- Exports with thousands of rows may take a few seconds
- Preview processes faster (only 10 rows)

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Always preview first** - Catch issues before importing into your accounting system.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use presets when possible** - They're optimized for each platform's requirements.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Save templates** - Avoid reconfiguring the same export every month.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Export regularly** - Monthly exports are easier to manage than annual catch-ups.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Keep a backup** - Download and store exports before importing to accounting software.
