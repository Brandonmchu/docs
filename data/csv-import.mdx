## Overview

Every Agent includes a powerful CSV import wizard that can import hundreds or thousands of records from spreadsheets - perfect for migrating from another system or bulk-loading data.

**Key capabilities:**
- Intelligent column mapping with auto-detection
- Support for clients, invoices, expenses, offerings, and time entries
- Batch processing for large files
- Validation and error handling
- Progress tracking for long imports

<Note>
  CSV imports are handled conversationally through Every Agent. Simply upload your file and chat with the agent to configure and execute your import.
</Note>

## Quick Start

**Basic import:** Open Every Agent chat → Upload CSV → Agent analyzes and proposes mapping → Review preview → Confirm → Import executes

**Example conversation:**
```
You: "Import this CSV of historical invoices"
[Attach CSV file]

Agent: "I found 500 invoices in your CSV. Here's my proposed mapping..."
```

## How Import Works

### Step 1: Upload CSV

Start by uploading your CSV file to the Every Agent chat:

```
You: "Import this CSV of historical invoices"
[Attach CSV file to chat]
```

### Step 2: Automatic Analysis

Agent analyzes your CSV and reports:
- Entity type detected (invoices, clients, etc.)
- Row count (e.g., "500 invoices found")
- Column identification
- Required field check
- Proposed batch size

### Step 3: Column Mapping

Agent shows proposed column mapping:

```
CSV Column          →  Every Field
─────────────────────────────────────
Client Name         →  client.name
Invoice Number      →  invoice_number
Invoice Date        →  issue_date
Amount              →  total
Due Date            →  due_date
Description         →  notes
```

**Adjust mappings as needed:**
```
You: "Map 'Customer' column to client.name instead"
Agent: [Updates mapping and shows revised preview]
```

### Step 4: Preview & Validation

Agent shows preview of first few rows:

```
Preview Row 1:
  Client: ACME Corp
  Amount: $5,000.00
  Date: 2024-01-15
  Due: 2024-02-14

Preview Row 2:
  Client: TechStart Inc
  Amount: $12,500.00
  Date: 2024-01-20
  Due: 2024-02-19

✓ All required fields present
✓ Dates in valid format
⚠ 3 clients don't exist yet (will be created)
```

### Step 5: Execute Import

```
You: "Looks good, proceed"

Agent: Starting import...
Batch 1/5: Processing rows 1-100... ✓ Complete (2.3s)
Batch 2/5: Processing rows 101-200... ✓ Complete (2.1s)
Batch 3/5: Processing rows 201-300... ✓ Complete (2.4s)
Batch 4/5: Processing rows 301-400... ✓ Complete (2.2s)
Batch 5/5: Processing rows 401-500... ✓ Complete (2.0s)

Import complete!
  ✓ 500 invoices created
  ✓ 47 new clients created
  ⚠ 3 rows skipped (invalid data)

### Invoices CSV (With Line Items)

## Handling Import Errors

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Missing client:**
- Problem: Invoice references client that doesn't exist
- Solution: Agent creates new client automatically using name from CSV

**Invalid date:**
- Problem: Date in unrecognized format
- Solution: Fix in CSV or tell agent: "Use MM/DD/YYYY format for dates"

**Duplicate invoices:**
- Problem: Invoice number already exists
- Solution: Agent skips duplicates, or specify: "Append -IMPORT to duplicate invoice numbers"

**Missing required fields:**
- Problem: Row missing required data
- Solution: Agent skips row and reports in summary

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent to handle errors:**
  - "Skip rows with missing client names and show me which ones"
  - "For duplicate invoice numbers, add '-OLD' suffix"
  - "Create new clients for any client names not found"
</Tip>

## Advanced Features

### Reusable Import Scripts

If you import similar CSVs regularly (like monthly expense reports), Every Agent can reuse the mapping:

```
You: "Import this month's expense report using last month's import script"
Agent: "Detected same structure, reusing mapping from January import..."
```

### Conditional Imports

Apply filters or transformations during import:

```
"Import invoices but only for clients with @acme.com email domain"
"Import expenses and mark all as billable to ACME Corp"
"Import clients but skip any already in the system"
```

### Progress Tracking

For large imports, you can close the browser and come back later:

```
Agent: "Import in progress (Batch 8/20)... You can close this window."

[Later, you return]

Agent: "Your import finished 10 minutes ago. 1,000 records imported."
```

### Batch Updates

Beyond imports, Every Agent can batch-update existing records:

```
"Update all clients in 'Enterprise' category to Net 45 payment terms"
"Add CC email accounts@company.com to all corporate clients"
"Archive all clients with no invoice activity in the last 2 years"
"Change tax rate to 13% on all offerings in the 'Consulting' category"
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start small** - Test with 10-20 rows first to verify mapping before importing thousands.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Clean data first** - Remove empty rows, fix formatting inconsistencies in Excel before uploading.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Backup first** - If importing to production, export existing data as backup before large imports.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use consistent dates** - Stick to one date format (YYYY-MM-DD recommended) throughout your CSV.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Check preview carefully** - Review sample rows to catch mapping errors before full import.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Import clients first** - If importing both clients and invoices, import clients first so invoices can link correctly.
</Tip>

## Common Workflows

### Migration from Another System

1. Export data from old system as CSV
2. Open Every Agent chat
3. Upload CSV: "Import these invoices from FreshBooks"
4. Review mapping and adjust as needed
5. Preview sample rows
6. Confirm and execute import
7. Verify imported data in Every

### Monthly Expense Import

1. Export expenses from bank/credit card as CSV
2. Upload to Every Agent
3. Agent recognizes format from previous imports
4. Quick review and import
5. Categorize any uncategorized expenses

### Bulk Client Onboarding

1. Prepare client list in Excel/Sheets
2. Export as CSV with Name, Email, Phone columns
3. Upload: "Import these 200 new clients"
4. Agent creates all client records
5. Review and enrich client data as needed

## Troubleshooting

**Import seems stuck:**
- Large imports may take several minutes
- Agent shows progress (e.g., "Batch 3/10")
- You can close browser and check back later

**Too many errors:**
- Clean your CSV data in Excel first
- Remove rows with missing required fields
- Ensure dates are in consistent format
- Check for special characters causing issues

**Wrong data imported:**
- Always preview before confirming import
- Use small test file first (10-20 rows)
- Check column mapping carefully

**Can't find imported records:**
- Check filters (may be filtering out imported data)
- Search by specific field values
- Ask agent: "Show me all records imported today"
