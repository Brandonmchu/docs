<Warning>
  **Import Wizard Coming Soon:** The structured CSV import wizard with column mapping is currently in development. However, Every Agent can already **read and extract data** from CSV, Excel, and Word files - perfect for processing receipts, invoices, reports, and other documents.
</Warning>

## Overview

Every provides multiple ways to import your business data:

**Direct Imports:**
- **Google Contacts** - Import all your Google contacts with one click
- **LinkedIn Connections** - Import your LinkedIn network from CSV export (with optional AI relationship summaries)

**File Processing (via Every Agent):**
- **CSV, Excel, Word** - Upload files to the agent chat for data extraction and analysis

<Tip>
  For importing existing contacts from other platforms, use the direct import options on the **Contacts** page. For processing data files or migrating from other invoicing systems, use Every Agent's file processing capabilities.
</Tip>

## LinkedIn Contacts Import

Import your LinkedIn connections directly into Every's Contacts system, complete with optional AI-powered relationship summaries from your message history.

### How to Export from LinkedIn

1. Go to [LinkedIn Data Privacy settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/privacy)
2. Click **"Get a copy of your data"**
3. Select **"Connections"** (and optionally **"Messages"** for AI summaries) and click **"Request archive"**
4. Wait for the email - LinkedIn often sends two exports over 24-48 hours. The second, larger one is the one you want
5. Download the ZIP and extract it
6. Find **Connections.csv** (and optionally **Messages.csv**) among the CSV files

### Importing LinkedIn Connections

Go to [**Contacts**](https://every.ai/contacts) page → Click **Import** dropdown → Select **LinkedIn** → Follow the wizard:

1. **Instructions** - Review the LinkedIn export steps
2. **Upload** - Drag and drop or browse for your `Connections.csv` file
3. **Preview** - See how many contacts will be imported (duplicates are automatically filtered)
4. **Import** - Click to import new contacts

**What gets imported:**
- Name (First + Last)
- Email address (if available on LinkedIn)
- Job title/Position
- Company (stored in notes for agent context)
- LinkedIn profile URL (stored as a social link)

<Note>
  Many LinkedIn connections don't share their email address. These contacts are still imported by name and can be enriched later to find contact details.
</Note>

### AI Relationship Summaries (Optional)

After importing contacts, you can upload your LinkedIn `Messages.csv` to generate AI-powered relationship timelines for each contact.

**How it works:**
1. After contact import completes, click **"Upload Messages.csv"**
2. Every matches your message history to imported contacts via LinkedIn profile URLs
3. AI analyzes your conversation history and generates concise summaries
4. Summaries appear in each contact's notes section

**Example AI summary:**
```
## LinkedIn Message History
2024 - Connected and discussed potential collaboration
2024 - Caught up at industry conference
2025 - Discussed hiring for board company
```

<Tip>
  Relationship summaries help Every Agent understand your history with each contact, enabling better personalized communication suggestions.
</Tip>

## Google Contacts Import

Import your entire Google Contacts library into Every with automatic deduplication and social link capture.

### Quick Import

Go to [**Contacts**](https://every.ai/contacts) page → Click **Import** dropdown → Select **Google Contacts**

**First time setup:**
1. Click **"Authorize Google Contacts"** if not already connected
2. Grant contacts read permission
3. Every fetches and analyzes your Google contacts

**Preview and Import:**
- See total contacts from Google
- View how many are new vs. already in Every
- Non-person contacts (organizations, bots) are automatically filtered
- Click **Import** to add new contacts

**What gets imported:**
- Name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Organization (stored in notes)
- Social URLs (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, etc.)

<Note>
  Google Contacts import is separate from the "Scan Contacts" workflow on the Home page. **Import** brings in all your Google contacts, while **Scan Contacts** uses AI to identify which contacts look like potential business clients.
</Note>

       - Sheet 1: Client List (150 rows) - names, emails, phone numbers
       - Sheet 2: Invoice History (500 rows) - dates, amounts, statuses
       - Sheet 3: Expenses (200 rows) - categories, merchants, amounts

       What would you like me to do with this data?"
```

```
You: "Read this Word document and summarize the key points"
[Attach DOCX file]

Agent: "This is a consulting agreement with the following key terms:
       - Client: Acme Corp
       - Rate: $175/hour
       - Scope: Website redesign and development

## How Import Works

### Step 1: Upload CSV

Start by uploading your CSV file to the Every Agent chat:

```
You: "Import this CSV of historical invoices"
[Attach CSV file to chat]
```

### Step 2: Automatic Analysis

Agent analyzes your CSV and reports:
- Entity type detected (invoices, clients, etc.)
- Row count (e.g., "500 invoices found")
- Column identification
- Required field check
- Proposed batch size

### Step 3: Column Mapping

Agent shows proposed column mapping:

```
CSV Column          →  Every Field
─────────────────────────────────────
Client Name         →  client.name
Invoice Number      →  invoice_number
Invoice Date        →  issue_date
Amount              →  total
Due Date            →  due_date
Description         →  notes
```

**Adjust mappings as needed:**
```
You: "Map 'Customer' column to client.name instead"
Agent: [Updates mapping and shows revised preview]
```

### Step 4: Preview & Validation

Agent shows preview of first few rows:

```
Preview Row 1:
  Client: ACME Corp
  Amount: $5,000.00
  Date: 2024-01-15
  Due: 2024-02-14

Preview Row 2:
  Client: TechStart Inc
  Amount: $12,500.00
  Date: 2024-01-20
  Due: 2024-02-19

✓ All required fields present
✓ Dates in valid format
⚠ 3 clients don't exist yet (will be created)
```

### Step 5: Execute Import

```
You: "Looks good, proceed"

Agent: Starting import...
Batch 1/5: Processing rows 1-100... ✓ Complete (2.3s)
Batch 2/5: Processing rows 101-200... ✓ Complete (2.1s)
Batch 3/5: Processing rows 201-300... ✓ Complete (2.4s)

```

## Handling Import Errors

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Missing client:**
- Problem: Invoice references client that doesn't exist
- Solution: Agent creates new client automatically using name from CSV

**Invalid date:**
- Problem: Date in unrecognized format
- Solution: Fix in CSV or tell agent: "Use MM/DD/YYYY format for dates"

**Duplicate invoices:**
- Problem: Invoice number already exists
- Solution: Agent skips duplicates, or specify: "Append -IMPORT to duplicate invoice numbers"

**Missing required fields:**
- Problem: Row missing required data
- Solution: Agent skips row and reports in summary

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent to handle errors:**
  - "Skip rows with missing client names and show me which ones"
  - "For duplicate invoice numbers, add '-OLD' suffix"
  - "Create new clients for any client names not found"
</Tip>

## Advanced Features

### Reusable Import Scripts

If you import similar CSVs regularly (like monthly expense reports), Every Agent can reuse the mapping:

```
You: "Import this month's expense report using last month's import script"
Agent: "Detected same structure, reusing mapping from January import..."
```

### Conditional Imports

Apply filters or transformations during import:

```
"Import invoices but only for clients with @acme.com email domain"
"Import expenses and mark all as billable to ACME Corp"
"Import clients but skip any already in the system"
```

### Progress Tracking

For large imports, you can close the browser and come back later:

```
Agent: "Import in progress (Batch 8/20)... You can close this window."

[Later, you return]

Agent: "Your import finished 10 minutes ago. 1,000 records imported."
```

### Batch Updates

Beyond imports, Every Agent can batch-update existing records:

```
"Update all clients in 'Enterprise' category to Net 45 payment terms"
"Add CC email accounts@company.com to all corporate clients"
"Archive all clients with no invoice activity in the last 2 years"
"Change tax rate to 13% on all offerings in the 'Consulting' category"
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start small and clean your data** - Test with 10-20 rows first, remove empty rows, and fix formatting inconsistencies in Excel before uploading large files.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use consistent date formats** - Stick to YYYY-MM-DD format throughout your CSV for best results.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Import clients first** - If importing both clients and invoices, import clients first so invoices can link correctly.
</Tip>

## Common Workflows

### Migration from Another System

1. Export data from old system as CSV
2. Open Every Agent chat
3. Upload CSV: "Import these invoices from FreshBooks"
4. Review mapping and adjust as needed
5. Preview sample rows
6. Confirm and execute import
7. Verify imported data in Every

### Monthly Expense Import

1. Export expenses from bank/credit card as CSV
2. Upload to Every Agent
3. Agent recognizes format from previous imports
4. Quick review and import
5. Categorize any uncategorized expenses

### Bulk Client Onboarding

1. Prepare client list in Excel/Sheets
2. Export as CSV with Name, Email, Phone columns
3. Upload: "Import these 200 new clients"
4. Agent creates all client records
5. Review and enrich client data as needed

## Troubleshooting

**Import seems stuck:**
- Large imports may take several minutes
- Agent shows progress (e.g., "Batch 3/10")
- You can close browser and check back later

**Too many errors:**
- Clean your CSV data in Excel first
- Remove rows with missing required fields
- Ensure dates are in consistent format
- Check for special characters causing issues

**Wrong data imported:**
- Always preview before confirming import
- Use small test file first (10-20 rows)
- Check column mapping carefully

**Can't find imported records:**
- Check filters (may be filtering out imported data)
- Search by specific field values
- Ask agent: "Show me all records imported today"
