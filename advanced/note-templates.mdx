## Overview

Note templates are reusable text snippets for invoices and proposals. Standardize payment terms, thank-you messages, and scope descriptions to save time and maintain consistency.

**Use templates in:**
- Invoice notes
- Proposal scope sections
- Client messages

**Benefits:** Consistency, time savings, and Every Agent integration for professional messaging

## Creating Note Templates

Go to **Invoices** → **Customize** → **Add Note Template**

**Fields:**
- **Name**: Internal identifier
- **Content**: The reusable text
- **Default** (optional): Auto-fill on new invoices

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create templates quickly:
  - "Create a note template called 'Net 30 Payment Terms' with standard payment instructions"
  - "Make a thank you message template for first-time clients"
  - "Create a project scope template for website development projects"
</Tip>

### Common Template Types

**Payment Terms:**
```
Payment due within 30 days. Late payments subject to 1.5% monthly interest.
```

**Thank You:**
```
Thank you for your business! We appreciate the opportunity to work with you.
```

**Project Scope:**
```
Includes design, development, testing, deployment. Two revision rounds included.
Timeline: 4-6 weeks from approval.
```

## Using Templates

### In Invoices

Create/edit invoice → **Notes** field → **Insert Template** → Select template → Edit if needed → Save

**Default templates** auto-fill on new invoices but can be overridden

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Apply templates to invoices:
  - "Use my standard payment terms template on this invoice for ACME Corp"
  - "Create an invoice with my 'Thank You' template in the notes"
  - "Add the late payment notice template to invoice #1234"
</Tip>

### In Proposals

**Scope/Client Message:** Click **Insert Template** → Select → Customize

### Setting Defaults

Edit template → Check **Default for Invoices/Proposals** → Save. All new documents will auto-fill with this template.

## Every Agent Integration

Every Agent references your templates when creating invoices/proposals, ensuring consistent language and maintaining your brand voice.

**Example:** "Create an invoice for ACME Corp" → Agent uses your default payment terms template automatically

## Managing Templates

**Access:** Go to **Invoices** → **Customize** to view and manage all your note templates

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage your template library:
  - "Show me all my note templates"
  - "List all payment terms templates"
  - "Create a new template for payment terms"
</Tip>

### Editing Templates

Open template → **Edit** → Update → **Save**

**Impact:** Only new uses get updated text. Existing documents preserved.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Update templates easily:
  - "Update my 'Net 30 Terms' template to change the email to billing@mybusiness.com"
  - "Edit the thank you template to add our new phone number"
  - "Change my default invoice template to include online payment instructions"
</Tip>

### Deleting Templates

In **Invoices** → **Customize**, find the template → **Delete** → Confirm. Historical documents with this template are preserved.

<Warning>
  Deleted templates cannot be recovered. Make sure you no longer need the template before deleting.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Create templates for repetitive text** - Anything typed more than 3 times deserves a template.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use clear names** - "Net 30 Payment Terms" > "Terms 1"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Set defaults** - Default templates save the most time on common documents.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Update regularly** - Keep contact info, policies, and pricing current.
</Tip>

## Template Examples

**Net 30 Payment Terms:**
```
Payment due within 30 days. We accept credit cards and bank transfers.
Late payments subject to 1.5% monthly interest.
```

**Thank You:**
```
Thank you for your business! We appreciate your trust and look forward
to continuing to serve you.
```

**Website Development Scope:**

```
