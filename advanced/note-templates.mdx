## Overview

Snippets are reusable text blocks for invoices and proposals. Standardize payment terms, thank-you messages, and scope descriptions to save time and maintain consistency.

**Use snippets in:**
- Invoice notes
- Proposal scope sections
- Client messages

**Benefits:** Consistency, time savings, and Every Agent integration for professional messaging

## Creating Snippets

Go to **Invoices** → **Customize** → **Add Snippet**

**Fields:**
- **Name**: Internal identifier
- **Content**: The reusable text
- **Default** (optional): Auto-fill on new invoices

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create snippets quickly:
  - "Create a snippet called 'Net 30 Payment Terms' with standard payment instructions"
  - "Make a thank you message snippet for first-time clients"
  - "Create a project scope snippet for website development projects"
</Tip>

### Common Snippet Types

**Payment Terms:**
```
Payment due within 30 days. Late payments subject to 1.5% monthly interest.
```

**Thank You:**
```
Thank you for your business! We appreciate the opportunity to work with you.
```

**Project Scope:**
```
Includes design, development, testing, deployment. Two revision rounds included.
Timeline: 4-6 weeks from approval.
```

## Using Snippets

### In Invoices

Create/edit invoice → **Notes** field → **Insert Snippet** → Select snippet → Edit if needed → Save

**Default snippets** auto-fill on new invoices but can be overridden

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Apply snippets to invoices:
  - "Use my standard payment terms snippet on this invoice for ACME Corp"
  - "Create an invoice with my 'Thank You' snippet in the notes"
  - "Add the late payment notice snippet to invoice #1234"
</Tip>

### In Proposals

**Scope/Client Message:** Click **Insert Snippet** → Select → Customize

### Setting Defaults

Edit snippet → Check **Default for Invoices/Proposals** → Save. All new documents will auto-fill with this snippet.

## Every Agent Integration

Every Agent references your snippets when creating invoices/proposals, ensuring consistent language and maintaining your brand voice.

**Example:** "Create an invoice for ACME Corp" → Agent uses your default payment terms snippet automatically

## Managing Snippets

**Access:** Go to **Invoices** → **Customize** to view and manage all your snippets

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage your snippet library:
  - "Show me all my snippets"
  - "List all payment terms snippets"
  - "Create a new snippet for payment terms"
</Tip>

### Editing Snippets

Open snippet → **Edit** → Update → **Save**

**Impact:** Only new uses get updated text. Existing documents preserved.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Update snippets easily:
  - "Update my 'Net 30 Terms' snippet to change the email to billing@mybusiness.com"
  - "Edit the thank you snippet to add our new phone number"
  - "Change my default invoice snippet to include online payment instructions"
</Tip>

### Deleting Snippets

In **Invoices** → **Customize**, find the snippet → **Delete** → Confirm. Historical documents with this snippet are preserved.

<Warning>
  Deleted snippets cannot be recovered. Make sure you no longer need the snippet before deleting.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Create snippets for repetitive text** - Anything typed more than 3 times deserves a snippet.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use clear names** - "Net 30 Payment Terms" > "Terms 1"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Set defaults** - Default snippets save the most time on common documents.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Update regularly** - Keep contact info, policies, and pricing current.
</Tip>
