## Overview

Note templates let you create reusable text snippets for invoices and proposals. Standardize payment terms, thank-you messages, scope descriptions, and other common text to save time and maintain consistency.

## What Are Note Templates?

Templates are saved text blocks that can be inserted into:
- Invoice notes
- Proposal scope sections
- Proposal client messages
- Email templates

**Benefits:**
- **Consistency**: Same professional messaging every time
- **Time Savings**: Don't retype common text
- **Professionalism**: Well-crafted, error-free messaging
- **AI Integration**: Agents reference templates for consistent language

## Creating Note Templates

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Note Templates**
2. Click **Create Template**
3. Fill in template details

**Required:**

- **Content**: The text to reuse

**Optional:**
- **Description**: What this template is for
- **Category**: Organize by type (Payment Terms, Thank You, Scope, etc.)
- **Default**: Set as default for invoices or proposals

4. Click **Save**

## AI Integration

Templates enhance AI Agent capabilities:

**How AI Uses Templates:**
- References stored templates when creating invoices/proposals
- Ensures consistent client-facing language
- Maintains your brand voice
- Reduces hallucinations (uses your actual text)

**Example:**
```
User: "Create an invoice for ACME Corp for consulting"
Agent: Generates invoice with your default payment terms template
Result: Consistent, professional invoice matching your brand
```

## Managing Templates

### Template Library

**Organization:**
- Create categories: Payment, Scope, Thank You, Legal, etc.
- Search by name or content
- Sort by category or frequency of use
- Archive outdated templates

### Editing Templates

**To Edit:**
1. Open template
2. Click **Edit**
3. Update content
4. Save changes

**Impact:**
- Existing invoices/proposals NOT affected
- Only new uses of template get updated text
- Historical documents preserved

### Deleting Templates

**To Delete:**
1. Open template
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

**Impact:**
- Template removed from library
- Cannot be inserted into new documents
- Historical uses preserved (text already in documents stays)

<Warning>
  Only delete templates you're certain you won't need. Consider archiving instead.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Create templates for repetitive text** - Anything you type more than 3 times deserves a template.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use clear template names** - "Net 30 Payment Terms" is better than "Terms 1".
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Keep templates professional** - These appear in client-facing documents.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review and update regularly** - Update contact info, policies, pricing as they change.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Set defaults for common cases** - Default invoice and proposal templates save the most time.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Categorize templates** - Helps find the right template quickly.
</Tip>
