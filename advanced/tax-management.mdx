## Overview

Every helps you collect sales tax, track deductible expenses, and generate compliance reports. Configure rates once, apply automatically, and simplify year-end preparation.

## Sales Tax Configuration

### Setting Default Tax Rate

Go to **Settings** → **Organization** → **Sales Tax Default** → Enter percentage (e.g., 13) → Save

**Common rates:** 5% (GST), 13% (ON/PEI HST), 15% (NS/NB/NL HST), 0% (exempt)

**Applied to:** New offerings, quick invoice creation, automation templates

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Configure your tax settings:
  - "Set my default sales tax rate to 13%"
  - "Change my organization's tax rate to 15% HST"
  - "What's my current default tax rate?"
</Tip>

### Per-Offering Tax Rates

Set different rates for different services (e.g., consulting 13%, educational workshops 0% exempt)

Create/edit offering → Set **Tax Rate** → Save. Rate applies when offering added to invoice.

### Per-Invoice Tax Control

**Line Item Tax:** Set rate per line, mix taxable and exempt on same invoice
**Invoice-Level Tax:** Apply single rate to entire invoice
**Tax-Exclusive (default):** Line amount + tax = total | **Tax-Inclusive:** Line amount includes tax

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Apply specific tax rates:
  - "Apply 8% tax to this line item on the invoice"
  - "Create an invoice with no tax for this exempt client"
  - "Add 15% HST to all items on invoice #1234"
</Tip>

## Tax Calculations

Every calculates tax automatically: Add line item → Tax rate applied → Tax calculated (`Line Total × Tax Rate`) → Grand total updated

**Example:** $1,000 consulting @ 13% = $130 tax = $1,130 total

**Multiple Rates:** Mix different rates per line (e.g., consulting 13%, workshop 0%)

**Tax on Discounts:** Tax calculated after discounts applied (Subtotal - Discount × Tax Rate)

## Regional Tax Rates

### Canadian Tax System

**GST:** 5% federal across Canada
**HST (Harmonized):** 13% (ON/PEI), 15% (NS/NB/NL)
**PST (Provincial):** 7% (BC), 6% (SK), 7% (MB), 9.975% (QC QST) - applied with GST
**GST Only:** AB, NT, NU, YT

<Note>
  Set your applicable rate manually in organization settings.
</Note>

### US Sales Tax

Varies by state (0-10%+). Consider nexus rules, local taxes, and product exemptions.

<Tip>
  Consult a tax professional for US sales tax - rules vary by jurisdiction.
</Tip>

## Expense Tax Tracking

Every tracks deductible expenses with amount, category, receipt, date, and description.

**Common deductible categories:** Advertising, Business Meals (50%), Software, Travel, Office Supplies, Insurance, Rent, Equipment, Education

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Track deductible expenses:
  - "Show me all tax-deductible expenses for 2024"
  - "How much did I spend on software subscriptions this year?"
</Tip>

### Year-End Export

Navigate to **Expenses** → Filter date range → Export CSV → Provide to accountant

<Tip>
  Keep all receipts! Required by IRS/CRA for expenses over certain thresholds.
</Tip>

## Tax Reporting

### Sales Tax Reports

**Reports** → **Tax Report** → Select date range → Export

**Includes:** Total sales, tax collected (by rate), client detail

**Use for:** Quarterly/annual remittance, audit prep, reconciliation

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Generate tax reports:
  - "Show me all tax collected this quarter"
  - "How much HST did I collect in Q4 2024?"
</Tip>

### Tax Liability

**Remittance Schedule:** Monthly (high-volume), Quarterly (most small businesses), Annually (very small)

<Warning>
  Tax collected is NOT your revenue - it must be remitted to tax authorities!
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Consult a tax professional** - Tax laws are complex. Get professional advice.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Keep all receipts** - Required for deductions and audit protection.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Remit on time** - Late remittance = penalties and interest. Set reminders.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review quarterly** - Don't wait until year-end. Review reports quarterly.
</Tip>

## Common Scenarios

**HST-Registered Canadian:**
- Set default to 13% (or applicable HST rate)
- Collect on invoices, track separately, file quarterly, remit minus input tax credits

**US Business in Sales Tax State:**
- Determine nexus, set state rate, register for permit
- Collect on in-state sales, file monthly/quarterly, remit

**Tax-Exempt Services:**
- Set default to 0%, no tax collected, still track deductible expenses

## Troubleshooting

**Wrong Tax Rate:**
- Draft: Edit invoice, update line item tax rate
- Issued: Void and recreate

**Tax Not Calculating:**
- Verify rate set on line item
- Enter as percentage (13, not 0.13)
- Check organization settings saved

**Multiple Taxes (GST + PST):**
- Workaround: Calculate combined rate (5% + 7% = 12%), apply as single rate
- Note on invoice: "Includes GST and PST"
- Future: Support for multiple simultaneous rates
