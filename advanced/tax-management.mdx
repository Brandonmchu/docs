## Overview

Every AI's tax management helps you collect sales tax, track tax-deductible expenses, and generate reports for tax compliance. Configure rates once, apply automatically, and simplify year-end tax preparation.

## Sales Tax Configuration

### Setting Default Tax Rate

Set your standard sales tax rate:

**To Configure:**
1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Organization**
2. Find **Sales Tax Default**
3. Enter percentage (e.g., 13 for 13%)
4. Save settings

**Common Rates:**
- **5%**: Canadian GST
- **13%**: Ontario HST, Prince Edward Island HST
- **15%**: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland HST
- **0%**: If you don't charge sales tax

**Where Applied:**
- New offerings default to this rate
- Quick invoice creation
- Automation templates

<Tip>
  Set your most common tax rate as default to save time on invoice creation.
</Tip>

### Per-Offering Tax Rates

Different tax rates for different offerings:

**Why This Matters:**
- Some products/services taxable, others not
- Different rates for different categories
- Exempt services (medical, educational, etc.)

**To Set:**
1. Create/edit offering
2. Set **Tax Rate** field
3. This rate applies when offering added to invoice
4. Save offering

**Example:**
```
Consulting Services: 13% (standard)
Software Development: 13% (standard)
Educational Workshops: 0% (exempt)
Medical Services: 0% (exempt)
```

### Per-Invoice Tax Control

Override tax for specific invoices:

**Line Item Tax:**
- Set tax rate per line item
- Mix taxable and non-taxable on same invoice
- Full flexibility

**Invoice-Level Tax:**
- Apply single rate to entire invoice
- Simpler for all-taxable or all-exempt invoices

**Tax-Inclusive vs Tax-Exclusive:**
- **Tax-Exclusive** (Default): Line amount + tax = total
- **Tax-Inclusive**: Line amount includes tax

## Tax Calculations

### Automatic Calculation

Every AI calculates tax automatically:

**How It Works:**
1. Add line item to invoice
2. Tax rate applied (from offering or manual)
3. Tax amount calculated: `Line Total × Tax Rate`
4. Tax added to invoice
5. Grand total updated

**Example:**
```
Line Item: Consulting Services
Amount: $1,000.00
Tax Rate: 13%
Tax Amount: $130.00
Line Total: $1,130.00
```

### Multiple Tax Rates

Different line items can have different rates:

**Example Invoice:**
```
Line 1: Consulting (13% tax)
  Subtotal: $1,000.00
  Tax: $130.00
  Total: $1,130.00

Line 2: Educational Workshop (0% tax)
  Subtotal: $500.00
  Tax: $0.00
  Total: $500.00

Invoice Total:
  Subtotal: $1,500.00
  Total Tax: $130.00
  Grand Total: $1,630.00
```

### Tax on Discounts

Tax calculated after discounts:

**Calculation Order:**
```
1. Line Item Subtotal
2. Apply Discount
3. Calculate Tax on discounted amount
4. Total = Discounted Subtotal + Tax
```

**Example:**
```
Original: $1,000
Discount 10%: -$100
Subtotal: $900
Tax 13%: $117
Total: $1,017
```

## Regional Tax Rates

### Canadian Tax System

**GST (Federal):**
- 5% across Canada
- Applied in addition to provincial tax in some provinces

**HST (Harmonized):**
- Combined federal and provincial
- **13%**: Ontario, Prince Edward Island
- **15%**: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland
- Replaces separate GST/PST

**PST (Provincial):**
- **7%**: British Columbia
- **6%**: Saskatchewan
- **7%**: Manitoba
- **9.975%**: Quebec (QST)
- Applied with GST (5% + PST)

**No Provincial Tax:**
- Alberta, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Yukon
- Only 5% GST applies

<Note>
  Every AI doesn't auto-select regional rates. Set your applicable rate in organization settings.
</Note>

### US Sales Tax

**State Sales Tax:**
- Varies by state (0% to over 10%)
- Local taxes may apply
- Nexus rules determine where you collect
- Some states have no sales tax

**Complexity:**

  Consult a tax professional for US sales tax compliance. Rules are complex and vary by jurisdiction.
</Tip>

## Expense Tax Tracking

### Tracking Deductible Expenses

All expenses tracked in Every AI support tax deductions:

**What's Tracked:**
- Expense amount
- Category (tax-friendly categories)
- Receipt (required for deductions)
- Date
- Description

**Tax-Deductible Categories:**
- Advertising & Marketing
- Business Meals (usually 50% deductible)
- Software & Subscriptions
- Travel
- Office Supplies
- Professional Services
- Insurance
- Rent & Utilities
- Equipment
- Education & Training

### Generating Expense Reports for Taxes

**Year-End Process:**
1. Navigate to **Expenses**
2. Filter date range (e.g., Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2025)
3. Review all expenses
4. Export to CSV
5. Provide to accountant

**What Accountant Needs:**
- Total per category
- Receipt documentation
- Business vs personal split (if applicable)
- Mileage logs (if claiming auto)

<Tip>
  Keep all expense receipts! The IRS/CRA requires receipts for expenses over certain thresholds.
</Tip>

## Tax Reporting

### Sales Tax Reports

Track tax collected:

**Report Includes:**
- Total sales
- Total tax collected
- Tax broken down by rate
- Date range
- Client-level detail

**Use Cases:**
- Quarterly tax remittance
- Annual tax filing
- Audit preparation
- Reconciliation

**Access:**
1. Navigate to **Reports** → **Tax Report**
2. Select date range
3. View tax collected summary
4. Export for filing

### Tax Liability Tracking

Know how much you owe:

**Tracking:**
- Tax collected from clients
- Tax remittance due dates
- Amount to remit
- Payment status

**Remittance Schedule:**
- **Monthly**: High-volume businesses
- **Quarterly**: Most small businesses
- **Annually**: Very small businesses

<Warning>
  Track tax remittance separately. Tax collected is not your revenue - it must be remitted to tax authorities!
</Warning>

## Compliance & Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Consult a tax professional** - Tax laws are complex. Get professional advice for your situation.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Keep all receipts** - Required for expense deductions and audit protection.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Separate business and personal** - Maintain separate accounts and track only business expenses.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Remit tax on time** - Late remittance = penalties and interest. Set reminders.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Update rates as laws change** - Tax rates and rules change. Stay informed.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Document exempt sales** - If you don't charge tax, document why (exempt customer, exempt product, etc.).
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review quarterly** - Don't wait until year-end. Review tax reports quarterly.
</Tip>

## Common Tax Scenarios

### HST-Registered Canadian Business

**Setup:**
- Sales Tax Default: 13% (Ontario HST example)
- Collect HST on most services

**Process:**
1. Create invoices with 13% tax
2. Collect tax from clients
3. Track in separate bank account
4. File HST return quarterly
5. Remit collected tax minus input tax credits

### US Business in Sales Tax State

**Setup:**
- Determine nexus (where you collect tax)
- Set appropriate state tax rate
- Register for sales tax permit

**Process:**
1. Collect sales tax on in-state sales
2. Track collected tax
3. File returns (monthly/quarterly)
4. Remit collected tax

### Tax-Exempt Services

**If Services Not Taxable:**
- Sales Tax Default: 0%
- No tax collected on invoices
- Still track expenses (those may be deductible)

## Troubleshooting

### Wrong Tax Rate Applied

**Problem:** Invoice has incorrect tax rate

**Solution:**
- If draft: Edit invoice, update tax rate per line item
- If issued: Void and create new invoice, or
- Issue credit note (future feature) to adjust

### Tax Not Calculating

**Check:**
- Tax rate set on line item
- Tax rate entered as percentage (13, not 0.13)
- Organization settings saved
- Browser cache cleared

### Multiple Taxes (GST + PST)

**Current Limitation:** Every AI supports single tax rate per line item

**Workaround:**
- Calculate combined rate (GST 5% + PST 7% = 12%)
- Apply as single rate
- Note in invoice: "Includes GST and PST"

**Future:** Support for multiple simultaneous tax rates
