## Overview

Every supports USD and CAD, allowing you to invoice clients in their preferred currency while maintaining your books in your primary currency.

**Features:**
- Set organization default currency
- Override per invoice
- Automatic formatting
- Exchange rate helpers for reporting

<Note>
  Both USD and CAD use the $ symbol, but the system tracks which currency is which.
</Note>

## Setting Default Currency

Go to **Settings** → **Organization** → **Default Currency** → Select USD or CAD → Save

**Impact:** New invoices, reports, and dashboard use this currency by default (can override per invoice)

**Choose based on:**
- **US Business**: Usually USD
- **Canadian Business**: Usually CAD
- **Cross-Border**: Majority of clients

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Set your default currency:
  - "Change my organization's default currency to CAD"
  - "Set USD as my default currency"
  - "What's my current default currency?"
</Tip>

## Per-Invoice Currency

When creating invoice: Select client → Choose **Currency** (USD or CAD) → Add line items → Send

**When to override:**
- Invoicing cross-border clients
- Client requests specific currency
- Contract specifies currency

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create invoices in different currencies:
  - "Create an invoice in CAD for my Canadian client ACME Corp"
  - "Make a USD invoice for this US client"
  - "Invoice this client in Canadian dollars for $2,500"
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Currency cannot be changed after invoice is issued. Double-check before sending!
</Warning>

## Currency Formatting

Every automatically formats both currencies as: $1,000.00 (dollar sign, comma separators, two decimals)

**Display:**
- Invoices show currency clearly
- Lists indicate currency per invoice
- Reports default to organization currency with optional per-currency breakdowns

## Exchange Rates

Every provides exchange rate helpers for cross-currency reporting (revenue totals, tax reports, financial analysis).

**How it works:** System converts foreign currency to your default using current rates

**Example:** USD default org with $5,000 USD + $3,000 CAD invoice = Combined $7,250 USD (at 1.33 rate)

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Get exchange rate information:
  - "What's the current exchange rate from USD to CAD?"
  - "Convert $5,000 CAD to USD"
  - "Show me my total revenue in USD including CAD invoices"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  For tax purposes, use the exchange rate from payment date (not invoice date). Consult your accountant.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Match client's currency** - Invoice in their local currency for faster payment.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Be consistent per client** - Stick with one currency per client relationship.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Specify in contracts** - Document currency in agreements to avoid disputes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Track for taxes** - Keep exchange rate records for tax filing.
</Tip>

## Common Scenarios

**US Business with Canadian Clients:**
- Default: USD
- For Canadian clients: Override to CAD on invoice creation
- Reports convert CAD to USD for analysis

**Canadian Business with US Clients:**
- Default: CAD
- For US clients: Override to USD on invoice creation
- Reports convert USD to CAD for analysis

**Mixed Client Base:**
- Set default to majority currency
- Override for minority
- Use exchange rate helpers for combined reporting

## Reporting

**Dashboard:** Totals in organization currency with automatic conversions. Filter by USD-only, CAD-only, or all.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Filter invoices by currency:
  - "Show me all invoices in Canadian dollars"
  - "How much have I invoiced in USD vs CAD this quarter?"
</Tip>

**Reports:**
- Revenue: Breakdown by currency with converted totals
- Tax: Convert all to organization currency for filing
- Client: Show original currency with optional conversion

## Limitations

**Current:**
- Only USD and CAD supported
- Cannot change currency after issuing
- Exchange rates approximate (use bank rates for taxes)

**Future:** Additional currencies (EUR, GBP), real-time exchange API, currency conversion at payment time

## Troubleshooting

**Wrong Currency:**
- Draft: Edit and change currency
- Issued: Void and recreate in correct currency

**Client Confusion:**
- Clearly mark currency on invoices
- Discuss currency in agreements upfront
- Resend with clarification if needed

**Accounting:**
- Export reports with conversions applied
- Provide exchange rate documentation
- Use organization default for consolidated reports
