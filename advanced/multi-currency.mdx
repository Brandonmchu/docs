## Setting Default Currency

### Organization Default

Set your primary currency in organization settings:

**To Set Default:**
1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Organization**
2. Find **Default Currency**
3. Select **USD** or **CAD**
4. Save settings

**What This Means:**
- All new invoices default to this currency
- Financial reports show in this currency
- Dashboard totals in this currency
- Can still override per invoice

**Choosing Your Default:**
- **US Business**: Usually USD
- **Canadian Business**: Usually CAD
- **Cross-Border**: Choose based on majority of clients

<Tip>
  Choose the currency you'll use most often. You can always override on specific invoices.
</Tip>

## Per-Invoice Currency

### Overriding Currency

Change currency for specific invoices:

**When Creating Invoice:**
1. Create new invoice
2. Select client
3. Find **Currency** dropdown
4. Select **USD** or **CAD**
5. Add line items (amounts in selected currency)
6. Save/send invoice

**When to Override:**
- US business invoicing Canadian client
- Canadian business invoicing US client
- Client request for specific currency
- Contract specifies currency

**Example Use Case:**
```
Organization Default: USD
Most clients: US-based, pay in USD

Special Case: Canadian client prefers CAD invoices
Action: Create invoice, select CAD currency
Result: Invoice displays prices in CAD
```

### Currency Lock

**Important:** Once invoice is issued, currency cannot be changed.

**Reasons:**
- Preserve invoice integrity
- Prevent exchange rate manipulation
- Maintain payment records accuracy
- Legal document consistency

<Warning>
  Double-check currency before sending invoice! You cannot change it after issuing.
</Warning>

## Currency Formatting

### Automatic Formatting

Every AI handles currency formatting automatically:

**USD Formatting:**
```
$1,000.00
$500.50
$1,234,567.89
```

**CAD Formatting:**
```
$1,000.00
$500.50
$1,234,567.89
```

**Features:**
- Dollar sign ($) prefix
- Comma thousands separators
- Two decimal places
- Proper rounding

### Display in UI

**Invoice View:**
- Currency shown on invoice
- All amounts in invoice currency
- Total clearly marked with currency

**List Views:**
- Currency indicator on each invoice
- Filter by currency
- Sort includes currency context

**Reports:**
- Default to organization currency
- Option to view per-currency breakdowns

## Exchange Rates

### Rate Helpers

Every AI provides exchange rate helpers for reporting:

**Use Cases:**
- Viewing total revenue across currencies
- Tax reporting in one currency
- Financial analysis
- Profit/loss calculations

**How It Works:**
- System uses current exchange rates
- Converts foreign currency to organization default
- Shows both original and converted amounts
- Updates rates regularly

**Example:**
```
Organization Default: USD

Invoices:
- Invoice #1: $5,000 USD
- Invoice #2: $3,000 CAD = ~$2,250 USD (at 1.33 rate)

Total Revenue Report:
- USD: $5,000
- CAD: $3,000 (≈ $2,250 USD)
- Combined: $7,250 USD
```

### Manual Conversions

For precise accounting:

**When Needed:**
- Tax filing
- Financial statements
- Annual reports
- Specific-date exchange rates

**Best Practice:**
- Use official exchange rate from payment date
- Document rate used
- Keep records for taxes
- Consult accountant for tax filing

<Tip>
  For tax purposes, use the exchange rate from the date payment was received, not invoice date.
</Tip>

## Multi-Currency Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Match client's currency** - Invoice clients in their local currency when possible for faster payment.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Be consistent per client** - Once you invoice a client in a currency, stick with it.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Specify currency in contracts** - Avoid disputes by documenting currency in agreements.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Track exchange rates** - Keep records of rates used for tax and accounting purposes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Consider payment processing fees** - Stripe fees may vary by currency.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review currency before sending** - Double-check invoice currency matches agreement.
</Tip>

## Common Scenarios

### US Business with Canadian Clients

### Mixed Client Base

**Setup:**
- Clients in both US and Canada

## Reporting Across Currencies

- Real-time exchange rate API
- Currency conversion at payment time
- Multi-currency financial reports

## Troubleshooting

### Wrong Currency on Invoice

**Solution:**
- Resend invoice with clear currency marking
- Explain exchange if needed
- Offer to re-invoice in different currency (as new invoice)

### Accounting Software Integration

**Challenge:** Accountant needs everything in one currency

**Solution:**
- Export reports with conversions applied
- Use organization default currency for reports
- Provide exchange rate documentation
- Consider accounting software integration
