## Overview

Collaborate with clients before invoicing. Build structured estimates, send professional documents, track status, and convert approved proposals into invoices with one click.

**Why use proposals:**
- Get client approval before doing work
- Set clear expectations
- Professional presentation
- One-click conversion to invoices
- Track approval status
- Reduce billing disputes

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create and manage proposals:
  - "Create a proposal for website redesign project, $15,000 for ACME Corp"
  - "Convert the approved ACME Corp proposal to an invoice"
  - "Show me all proposals awaiting approval"
  - "Duplicate the ACME proposal for Client XYZ"
</Tip>

## Quick Start

**Create:** Proposals → Create Proposal → Add client, title, line items, scope → Save as Draft or Send
**Send:** Complete proposal → Send Proposal → Email sent to client with link
**Convert:** Open approved proposal → Convert to Invoice → Review → Send invoice

## Proposal vs Invoice

**Proposals** are pre-work estimates sent before work begins for client review and approval. They can be negotiated and revised, and are not demands for payment.

**Invoices** are post-work payment requests sent after work is complete (or at milestones). They demand payment, are less negotiable, and are legal documents.

<Tip>
  Use proposals for new clients, large projects, or work where scope needs approval first.
</Tip>

## Creating Proposals

<Note>
  **Required to Create a Proposal:**
  - **Client** (select from existing clients)
  - **Title** (descriptive name of proposal)
  - **At least one line item** (scope description and pricing)

  **To Convert to Invoice:** Proposal must be in **Approved** status (client has clicked "Approve Proposal").
</Note>

### Basic Creation

Go to Proposals → Create Proposal → Fill required fields (client, title, line items) and optional fields (scope, client message, media, attachments, terms, expiration) → Save as Draft or Send

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create proposals:
  - "Draft a proposal for consulting services at $150/hour for Client XYZ"
  - "Make a proposal: branding package for $5,000 to Sarah's company"
  - "Generate a proposal for mobile app development, 3 months at $12,000"
</Tip>

### Key Components

**Title & Scope:** Short descriptive title (e.g., "Website Redesign Proposal") plus detailed scope covering what's included/excluded, timeline, deliverables, and success criteria.

**Example scope:**
```
Complete website redesign including:
- 5 page designs (Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact)
- Mobile-responsive layouts
- Custom branding integration
- 2 rounds of revisions

Timeline: 6 weeks from approval
Not included: Content writing, photography, ongoing maintenance
```

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Add scope:
  - "Add detailed scope to this proposal describing 5-page website build"
  - "Include project timeline of 6 weeks in the proposal scope"
  - "Update scope to specify what's NOT included in the project"
</Tip>

**Client Message:** Personal greeting, context about the proposal, why you're excited, and next steps. Adds warmth to professional document.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Add messages:
  - "Add a friendly greeting message to this proposal for Sarah"
  - "Write a message explaining why I'm excited about this project"
</Tip>

**Line Items:** Same powerful system as invoices. Select from pre-defined offerings for consistency or create custom line items with description, quantity, rate, tax, and discounts.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage line items:
  - "Add a line item to this proposal: Website Design, $8,000"
  - "Include my 'Consulting Services' offering in the proposal"
  - "Add 40 hours of development time at $150/hour to proposal"
</Tip>

**Media & Attachments:** Add inline images (mockups, design samples, portfolio) and downloadable files (specifications, contracts, reference materials). Supported formats: JPG, PNG, PDF, DOCX (up to 5MB per file).

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Add media:
  - "Attach this mockup image to the proposal"
  - "Add contract PDF to the proposal attachments"
  - "Include portfolio samples in the proposal media"
</Tip>

## Proposal Status Flow

**Draft** → Work in progress, not sent, can edit freely
**Issued** → Sent to client, awaiting response, public page available
**Approved** → Client accepted, work can begin, ready to convert to invoice (captures signer name, email, timestamp)
**Rejected** → Client declined, preserved for records
**Void** → Cancelled/obsolete, preserved for history

<Note>
  Unlike invoices, proposals can be revised and reissued if client requests changes.
</Note>

## Sending Proposals

### Delivery

**Process:** Complete proposal → Review details → Send Proposal → Confirm → Email sent to client with branded message and proposal link

Client receives email with link to secure, branded proposal page featuring your logo, full proposal details, line items, scope, media/attachments, and "Approve Proposal" button.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Send proposals:
  - "Send the ACME Corp proposal to their email"
  - "Email the website redesign proposal to Sarah"
  - "Issue the proposal for the branding project"
  - "Generate a PDF of this proposal for me to review"
</Tip>

### What Clients See

When clients click the proposal link, they land on a professional, branded public page:

**Header:**
- Your business logo
- Your business name and contact info
- Proposal number and title
- Issue date

**Proposal Details:**
- Client message (personal greeting)
- Detailed scope section
- Itemized line items with descriptions
- Subtotal, taxes, discounts, total
- Payment terms and expiration date

**Media & Attachments:**
- Inline images/mockups
- Downloadable attachments
- Portfolio samples

**Call to Action:**
- Prominent "Approve Proposal" button
- Option to print or download PDF
- Contact information if questions

**Mobile-Optimized:** Clients can review and approve from phone or tablet

<Note>
  Proposal pages are publicly accessible via unique URL but not indexed by search engines. Only people with the link can view.
</Note>

### PDF Generation

Generate professional PDF versions of proposals for offline sharing, client records, or printing.

**To generate:**
- Open proposal → Click "Generate PDF" → Download
- Or ask Every Agent: "Create a PDF of this proposal"

**PDF includes:**
- All proposal details (scope, line items, terms)
- Your branding (logo, colors)
- Professional formatting
- Approval status (if approved)

**Use cases:**
- Email as attachment alongside proposal link
- Print for in-person meetings
- Archive for client records
- Share via platforms that don't allow links

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Generate PDFs:
  - "Create a PDF of the ACME Corp proposal"
  - "Generate proposal PDF to attach to my email"
  - "Make a printable version of this proposal"
</Tip>

### Tracking

Track proposal engagement with email delivered, opened, link clicked, proposal viewed, and approved/rejected events. Know when client viewed proposal to time follow-ups appropriately.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Track status:
  - "Has ACME Corp viewed their proposal yet?"
  - "Show me all pending proposals"
  - "Which proposals are awaiting approval?"
</Tip>

## Approval Process

**Client side:** Receives email → Clicks link → Reviews details → Clicks "Approve Proposal" → Enters name and email → Submits

**Your side:** Receive notification → Approval details recorded (name, email, timestamp, IP) → Status changes to Approved → Ready to convert to invoice

<Tip>
  Captured approval creates clear record of client agreement before work begins!
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Handle approvals:
  - "Did ACME Corp approve their proposal?"
  - "Show me all approved proposals from last month"
  - "List proposals that clients have approved but not yet invoiced"
</Tip>

## Converting to Invoices

One of the most powerful features: instant conversion of approved proposals to invoices.

**Process:** Open approved proposal → Convert to Invoice → New invoice created with same client, line items, attachments, and proposal reference → Review → Adjust dates/payment terms if needed → Send

**What's preserved:** All line items, client info, attachments, descriptions, pricing, discounts, taxes
**What's not copied:** Scope description, client message, proposal-specific media

<Tip>
  Converting proposal to invoice takes seconds. No retyping line items or amounts!
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Convert to invoices:
  - "Turn this proposal into an invoice and send it"
  - "Create invoice from the website redesign proposal"
  - "Convert proposal #123 to an invoice"
</Tip>

## Managing Proposals

### Viewing & Filtering

Proposal list shows all proposals with status filters (draft, issued, approved, rejected), search by client or title, sort by date or amount, and summary cards for total value and approval rate.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** View proposals:
  - "Display draft proposals that haven't been sent"
  - "What proposals did I create for ACME Corp?"
  - "Show me proposals from last quarter"
</Tip>

### Editing

**Draft proposals:** Edit freely, all fields editable
**Issued proposals:** Limited editing to preserve what client saw, can add notes but can't change amounts, create new version for major changes

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Edit proposals:
  - "Update the ACME proposal to change the price to $18,000"
  - "Edit this proposal and add another line item"
  - "Adjust the scope in the draft proposal"
</Tip>

### Duplicating

Reuse proposals for similar projects by duplicating existing ones.

**Process:** Open proposal → Duplicate → New draft created → Edit for new client/project → Send

**Use cases:** Similar projects for different clients, same service package to multiple clients, revised proposal after feedback.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Duplicate proposals:
  - "Duplicate the ACME proposal for Client XYZ"
  - "Create a new proposal based on the website redesign one"
  - "Make a duplicate of proposal #123 with updated pricing"
</Tip>

### Voiding

Cancel obsolete proposals when client went with competitor, project cancelled, superseded by revised proposal, or no longer relevant.

**Process:** Open proposal → Void Proposal → Add reason (optional) → Confirm

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Void proposals:
  - "Void the ACME Corp proposal"
  - "Cancel this proposal because client went with competitor"
  - "Mark proposal #123 as void"
</Tip>

## Proposal Templates

Reuse standard messaging for consistency and speed.

**Note Templates** include standard thank-you messages, scope descriptions, payment terms, and project timelines. Insert via template selector when creating/editing proposals.

**Default templates:** Set in Settings → Note Templates to auto-fill new proposals with standard content.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Use templates:
  - "Insert the standard thank-you template into this proposal"
  - "Add my payment terms template to the proposal"
  - "Use the 'consulting scope' template for this proposal"
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Be specific in scope** - Clear scope prevents misunderstandings and scope creep.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use professional media** - Include examples of your work to impress prospects.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Set expiration dates** - Creates urgency and keeps pricing current.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Follow up after 3-5 days** - If no response, check in with client.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Convert to invoice promptly** - Once approved, convert and send invoice to get paid.
</Tip>

## Common Workflows

### Full Proposal-to-Invoice Flow

Prospect inquiry → Discovery call → Create proposal with scope/pricing → Send → Track when opened → Follow up after 3 days → Client approves → Convert to invoice → Begin work → Complete work → Client pays

### Revised Proposal After Negotiation

Send initial proposal → Client requests changes → Duplicate original → Adjust scope/pricing → Add note: "Revised per our discussion" → Send revised → Client approves → Convert to invoice

## Troubleshooting

**Client can't approve:** Ensure proposal is issued (not draft), link is correct, not expired, browser allows form submission.

**Conversion doesn't copy everything:** Normal behavior - scope and client message are proposal-specific. Line items, attachments, and client info DO copy. Add invoice-specific notes separately.
