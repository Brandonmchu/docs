## Overview

Proposals let you collaborate with clients before invoicing. Build structured estimates, send professional documents, track status, and convert approved proposals into invoices with one click.

**Why Use Proposals:**
- Get client approval before doing work
- Set clear expectations
- Professional presentation
- Seamless conversion to invoices
- Track approval status
- Reduces billing disputes

## Proposal vs Invoice

**Proposals** are pre-work estimates:
- Sent before work begins
- Client reviews and approves
- Can be negotiated and revised
- Not a demand for payment
- Becomes invoice after approval

**Invoices** are post-work payment requests:
- Sent after work complete (or milestone)
- Demands payment
- Less negotiable
- Legal document

<Tip>
  Use proposals for new clients, large projects, or work where scope needs approval first.
</Tip>

## Common Workflows

### Full Proposal-to-Invoice Flow

1. Prospect inquiry
2. Discovery call

4. Send proposal
5. Track when client opens it
6. Follow up after 3 days
7. Client approves
8. Convert to invoice
9. Begin work
10. Complete work
11. Client pays invoice

### Revised Proposal After Negotiation

1. Send initial proposal
2. Client requests changes
3. Duplicate original proposal
4. Adjust scope and/or pricing
5. Add note: "Revised per our discussion"

## Troubleshooting

### Client Can't Approve Proposal

**Check:**
- Proposal is issued (not draft)
- Link is correct
- Not expired
- Browser allows form submission

### Conversion Doesn't Copy Everything

**Normal:** Scope and client message are proposal-specific and don't copy.

**Solution:** Line items, attachments, and client info DO copy. Add invoice-specific notes separately.
