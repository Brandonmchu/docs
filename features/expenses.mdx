## Overview

Track business expenses for tax purposes and bill them back to clients. Upload receipts, let Every Agent extract details, categorize expenses, and seamlessly add billable expenses to invoices.

**Key capabilities:**
- Receipt scanning with Every Agent AI extraction
- Expense categorization for tax reporting

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create and manage expenses:
  - "Log an expense: $45 at Office Depot for supplies"
  - "Scan this receipt and create an expense"
  - "Mark this expense as billable to ACME Corp"
  - "Add all unbilled expenses for ACME Corp to their invoice"
</Tip>

## Quick Start

**Basic expense:** Expenses → Add Expense → Fill merchant, amount, date, category → Save
**Receipt scanning:** Add Expense → Upload receipt → Every Agent extracts details → Review → Save
**Bill to client:** Mark as billable → Select client → Add to invoice when ready

## Creating Expenses

<Note>
  **Required to Create an Expense:**
  - **Merchant name** (business where expense occurred)
  - **Amount** (total spent)
  - **Date** (when expense occurred)

  **To Bill Expenses to Clients:** Mark as billable and select a client. Upload receipts for tax compliance.
</Note>

### Basic Expense Entry

Go to Expenses → Add Expense → Fill required fields (merchant, amount, date) and optional fields (category, description, receipt, client) → Save

<Tip>
  Upload receipts for all expenses! They're required for tax deductions and audit protection.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create expenses:
  - "Add a business expense for $120 software subscription"
  - "Record $87 spent at Starbucks for client meeting"
  - "Create expense for $250 at Delta Airlines for travel"
</Tip>

### Receipt Scanning with Every Agent AI

Every's AI-powered receipt scanner automatically extracts expense details from photos and PDFs, eliminating manual data entry.

#### How Receipt OCR Works

**Step-by-step:**
1. Take a photo of your receipt or have a PDF ready
2. Go to **Expenses** → **Add Expense** OR ask Every Agent "Log this receipt"
3. Upload the image/PDF (drag & drop or click to browse)
4. Every Agent's AI analyzes the receipt and extracts:
   - **Merchant name** (business name)
   - **Total amount** (final charged amount)
   - **Date** (transaction date)
   - **Category** (expense type based on merchant)
   - **Payment method** (if visible: card, cash, check)
5. Review the extracted data in the form
6. Correct any inaccuracies
7. Add optional details (client for billback, notes)
8. Save expense

**Supported formats:** JPG, PNG, HEIC (iPhone photos), PDF
**File size limit:** Up to 10MB per receipt
**Processing time:** Typically 2-5 seconds

#### What AI Can Extract

**High accuracy (95%+):**
- Merchant/business name
- Final total amount
- Transaction date
- Business address

**Good accuracy (85-90%):**
- Itemized line items
- Subtotal vs total
- Tax amount
- Payment method

**Moderate accuracy (70-80%):**
- Category classification
- Tip amounts
- Multiple currency symbols

**Tips for best results:**
- Use clear, well-lit photos
- Capture entire receipt (top to bottom)
- Avoid shadows and glare
- Ensure text is readable
- Flatten crumpled receipts before photographing

<Note>
  Always review Every Agent-extracted data before saving. The AI is highly accurate but not perfect, especially for handwritten receipts or faded text.
</Note>

#### Batch Receipt Processing

Process multiple receipts at once by asking Every Agent:

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Batch process receipts:
  - "Process these 5 receipts and create expenses" (upload multiple files)
  - "I have several receipts from my business trip - extract all the expenses"
  - "Log all these receipts as billable expenses for ACME Corp"
</Tip>

**How batch processing works:**
1. Upload multiple receipt images in one message
2. Every Agent processes each receipt in parallel
3. Creates individual expense records for each
4. Returns summary with all created expenses
5. You can review and edit any that need adjustments

**Best for:** Conference expenses, business trips, monthly receipt catch-up

#### Common OCR Issues & Fixes

**Issue: Wrong amount extracted**
- **Cause:** AI read subtotal or tax line instead of total
- **Fix:** Always verify total is correct, adjust manually if needed

**Issue: Date is incorrect**
- **Cause:** Receipt has multiple dates (printed date vs transaction date)
- **Fix:** Check transaction date on credit card statement if unclear

**Issue: Category is wrong**
- **Cause:** Merchant doesn't clearly indicate business type
- **Fix:** Manually select correct category (AI learns from corrections)

**Issue: Merchant name truncated**
- **Cause:** Receipt shows abbreviated name
- **Fix:** Edit to full business name for better record-keeping

**Issue: Receipt unreadable**
- **Cause:** Poor photo quality, faded thermal receipt, crumpled paper
- **Fix:** Re-photograph in better lighting, or enter data manually

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Troubleshoot extraction:
  - "This receipt extracted the wrong amount - the total should be $87.50"
  - "Fix the merchant name to be 'Office Depot' instead of 'OFDP'"
  - "Change this expense category to Travel"
</Tip>

#### Mobile Receipt Scanning

**Best practice workflow:**
1. Get receipt at point of purchase
2. Immediately take photo with phone camera
3. Open Every in browser or text/email photo to yourself
4. Upload to Every Agent: "Log this receipt"
5. Receipt processed and expense created in seconds
6. Delete photo from phone (receipt stored in Every)

**Pro tip:** Create a "Receipts" folder in your photo library for temporary storage, then batch upload weekly.

## Expense Categories

Organize expenses by type for tax reporting:

**Common categories:** Advertising & Marketing, Business Meals, Software & Subscriptions, Travel, Office Supplies, Professional Services, Insurance, Rent & Utilities, Equipment, Education & Training, Other

Categories align with common tax deduction types to make year-end tax preparation easier.

<Tip>
  Consistent categorization makes tax time much easier. Choose categories carefully and use them consistently.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Categorize expenses:
  - "Categorize this expense as office supplies"
  - "Show me all expenses categorized as Software & Subscriptions"
  - "Change the category of my last expense to Travel"
</Tip>

## Billable Expenses

Bill expenses back to clients by marking them billable and adding to invoices.

### Marking as Billable

**When creating:** Add expense → Check "Billable to Client" → Select client → Save
**Existing expense:** Edit expense → Check "Billable to Client" → Select client → Save

Billable expenses show client name, "Unbilled" status until invoiced, and can be filtered by billable status.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Mark expenses billable:
  - "Make my last 3 expenses billable to Client XYZ"
  - "Set this travel expense as billable to the website project client"
  - "Which expenses are unbilled for ACME Corp?"
</Tip>

### Adding to Invoices

**Process:** Create invoice → Select client → Click "Add from Expenses" → Select unbilled expenses → Add Selected → Expenses become line items with description and amount → Marked as "Billed"

**Example:**
```
Expense: Client meeting travel, $145.50, Category: Travel

Becomes Invoice Line Item:
  Description: Client meeting travel
  Amount: $145.50
  Quantity: 1
```

**Markup options:** Add percentage markup, round to nearest $5/$10, or add flat handling fee as needed.

<Tip>
  Clearly communicate your expense policy with clients upfront. Some expect expenses at cost, others accept markup.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Add expenses to invoices:
  - "Create an invoice with Client XYZ's unbilled expenses"
  - "Add this travel expense to ACME's current invoice"
  - "Bill all expenses from last month to Client ABC"
</Tip>

## Managing Expenses

### Viewing & Filtering

**Expense List** shows all expenses with filters for date range, category, client, billable status, and search by merchant/description.

**Summary Metrics** display total expenses, billable expenses, unbilled value, and breakdown by category.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** View expenses:
  - "Show me all expenses from last month"
  - "Display all travel expenses from Q1"
  - "What expenses did I log for ACME Corp?"
</Tip>

### Editing & Deleting

**Editing:** All fields can be edited anytime except billed expenses linked to issued invoices (limited editing to preserve invoice accuracy).

**Deleting:** Can delete unbilled expenses anytime. Cannot delete billed expenses unless removed from invoice first.

<Warning>
  Keep expense records for tax purposes. Only delete expenses recorded in error.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Edit or delete:
  - "Change the amount on my last expense to $52.50"
  - "Update yesterday's expense description to include client name"
  - "Delete the duplicate expense from yesterday"
</Tip>

### Receipt Management

**Uploading:** Create/edit expense → Upload Receipt → Select image/PDF → Receipt attached and stored securely
**Storage:** Cloud-based, accessible anytime, downloadable, backed up automatically
**Multiple receipts:** Upload all relevant documentation per expense
**Missing receipts:** Add expense without receipt, upload later when found

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage receipts:
  - "Upload this receipt to my last expense"
  - "Show me all expenses without receipts"
  - "Attach this image to the Office Depot expense"
</Tip>

## Expense Reporting

### Analytics

Track spending patterns with metrics for total expenses by period, breakdown by category, billable vs non-billable, unbilled value, and average expense amount.

**Date ranges:** Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly (for taxes).

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Generate reports:
  - "Show me total expenses for last month"
  - "Generate an expense report for Q1 2024"
  - "Create a year-end expense report for tax purposes"
</Tip>

### Category & Client Breakdowns

**By category:** View total per category, percentage of total, trends over time, and tax-deductible totals for tax preparation and budget planning.

**By client:** View total expenses per client, billable vs billed amounts, unbilled expenses, and expense types to ensure all client expenses are billed and track project costs.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Get breakdowns:
  - "How much did I spend on travel last month?"
  - "Show me all software subscription expenses this year"
  - "What's the total unbilled expense amount for Client XYZ?"
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Always upload receipts** - Required for tax deductions and protects in audits.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Log expenses immediately** - Don't wait until month-end. Log as they occur while details are fresh.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use consistent categories** - Makes tax preparation and reporting much easier.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review unbilled expenses regularly** - Check weekly or monthly to ensure you're not missing billbacks.
</Tip>

## Common Workflows

### Daily Expense Logging

**Throughout day:** Log expenses as they occur → Upload receipt photos → Mark billable to client → Categorize
**End of day:** Review entries → Verify receipts uploaded → Check categorization

### Monthly Billback

**Throughout month:** Log all client expenses → Mark as billable → Upload receipts
**End of month:** Filter expenses by client → Create invoice → Add all unbilled expenses → Send invoice → All marked as billed

### Year-End Tax Prep

**Throughout year:** Log all business expenses → Categorize correctly → Upload receipts
**Year-end:** Generate full-year expense report → Review categories → Export data → Provide to accountant

## Troubleshooting

**Receipt upload failed:** Check file size (under 5MB), format (JPG, PNG, PDF), internet connection, browser file upload permissions. Compress large images if needed.

**Every Agent extracted wrong amount:** Common issue is reading tax/subtotal instead of total. Always review extracted data and correct before saving.

**Can't edit billed expense:** Expense is linked to issued invoice. Remove from invoice first (if draft) or accept current values to maintain invoice accuracy.

**Expense not in "Add to Invoice":** Verify expense is marked billable, assigned to correct client, not already billed, and exists (not deleted).
