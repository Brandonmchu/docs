## Quick Start

**Live Timer:** Start Timer → Select client → Add description → Work → Stop
**Manual Entry:** Go to [**Timesheet**](https://every.ai/timesheet) → **Add Time Entry** → Fill details (client, description, duration, rate) → Save

## Time Tracking Methods

### Live Timer Widget

Real-time tracking with a floating timer that stays visible across all pages.

**Usage:** Click Start Timer → Select client → Add work description → Timer runs in background → Pause/resume as needed → Stop when complete

Timer widget floats in corner, tracks elapsed time, and doesn't interfere with other work.

<Tip>
  The timer widget stays active even if you navigate to different pages. Your time keeps tracking!
</Tip>

### Manual Time Entry

Add time records after the fact for forgotten timer starts, historical time, or batch entry.

**Process:** Go to [**Timesheet**](https://every.ai/timesheet) → **Add Time Entry** → Fill in client, description, start/end time (duration auto-calculates), hourly rate, and billable status → Save

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Log time manually:
  - "Record 5 hours of development time for Project ABC from 9am to 2pm today"
  - "Add billable time: 1.5 hours client call with Sarah this morning"
</Tip>

## Time Record Details

<Note>
  **Required to Track Time:**
  - **Client** (required for billable time; internal work can be non-billable without client)
  - **Description** (what work was performed)
  - **Duration** (hours worked) or start/end times

  **To Convert to Invoices:** Time must be marked as **Billable** and in **Unbilled** status.
</Note>

Each time record includes:
- **Client**: Who you worked for (required for billable time)
- **Description**: What work was performed (appears on invoice when billed)
- **Duration**: Start time, end time, total hours calculated
- **Rate**: Hourly rate for this work
- **Billing Status**: Unbilled, Billed, or Non-billable
- **Date**: When work was performed

### Billable vs Non-Billable

**Billable time** will be invoiced to client and counts toward revenue. **Non-billable time** is for internal work, learning, pro bono, or admin tasks that won't be charged.

<Tip>
  Mark administrative work and internal meetings as non-billable to track time accurately without over-billing.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage billing status:
  - "Show me all unbilled time for ACME Corp"
  - "Mark the last 3 time entries as non-billable"
  - "Which clients have unbilled time this month?"
</Tip>

## Hourly Rate Management

**Set rates per time entry** for flexible pricing on different work types, or **set client-specific defaults** to auto-apply rates to new entries.

**Example rates:**
- Client A - Standard Consulting: $150/hour
- Client A - After-hours Support: $225/hour
- Client B - Development: $175/hour

**Rate changes:** Old time records keep original rate, new records use new rate. No retroactive changes preserves historical accuracy.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Set or update rates:
  - "Set my hourly rate for ACME Corp to $175"
  - "Update Client XYZ's rate to $200 per hour"
  - "What's my current hourly rate for each client?"
</Tip>

## Converting Time to Invoices

### Adding Time to Invoices

The main benefit: Easy invoicing!

**Process:** Create invoice → Select client → Click "Add from Time Tracking" → Select unbilled time records → Add Selected → Time becomes line items with hours × rate calculation → Records marked as Billed

**Example:**
```
Time Record: Website Development, 5.5 hours @ $150/hour
Invoice Line Item:
  Description: Website Development
  Quantity: 5.5
  Rate: $150
  Total: $825
```

<Tip>
  Time tracking makes invoicing incredibly fast. Just select unbilled time and everything calculates automatically!
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Add time to invoices:
  - "Add all unbilled time for ACME Corp to an invoice"
  - "Create an invoice with this week's time for Client XYZ"
  - "Convert unbilled time for Project ABC into an invoice"
</Tip>

### Batch Invoicing

Invoice multiple time records at once for monthly billing or project completion.

**Example:** Track time all month → Create invoice at month-end → Select all unbilled time → Add to invoice → Review total → Send

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Batch invoice time:
  - "Create an invoice for all of Client ABC's unbilled time this month"
  - "Add all unbilled time from January to an invoice for ACME Corp"
</Tip>

## Managing Time Records

### Viewing & Filtering

**Time List View** shows all records with filters for client, billable status, date range, and search by description.

**Summary Cards** display total hours tracked, billable/non-billable breakdown, unbilled amount, and revenue from billed time.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** View time records:
  - "Show me my time entries for last week"
  - "What time did I track for ACME Corp this month?"
  - "Display all non-billable time entries from January"
</Tip>

### Editing & Deleting

**Unbilled time** can be edited freely (description, duration, rate, billable status). **Billed time** cannot be edited to preserve invoice accuracy.

**Deleting:** Can delete unbilled time anytime. Cannot delete billed time unless removed from invoice first.

<Warning>
  Only delete time records recorded in error. Deleting loses the historical record.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Edit or delete:
  - "Update yesterday's time entry to 4 hours instead of 3"
  - "Change the description on my last time entry to 'Strategic consulting call'"
  - "Delete my last time entry"
</Tip>

## Time Tracking Reports

### Analytics

Track productivity and billing with metrics like total hours by client, billable vs non-billable breakdown, average hourly rate, utilization rate, revenue from time tracking, and unbilled time value.

**Date ranges:** Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly overviews available.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Generate analytics:
  - "Show me a breakdown of my time this month"
  - "How many billable hours did I track last week?"
  - "What's my total unbilled time value?"
</Tip>

### Client Time Reports

View total hours per client, revenue generated, average rate, project breakdowns, and unbilled time to identify most valuable clients and ensure nothing goes unbilled.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Get client reports:
  - "How many hours have I worked for ACME Corp this year?"
  - "Show me revenue generated from Client XYZ"
  - "List all clients with unbilled time right now"
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Use the timer widget** - Real-time tracking is more accurate than manual entry after the fact.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Add descriptions immediately** - Don't wait. Add what you're working on when you start the timer.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Bill regularly** - Convert unbilled time to invoices weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review unbilled time** - Check regularly to ensure nothing falls through the cracks.
</Tip>

## Common Workflows

### Daily Consulting

**During work:** Start timer for each client task → Select client → Add description → Work → Stop timer
**End of day:** Review entries for accuracy → Adjust descriptions if needed
**End of week:** Create invoices → Add unbilled time → Send invoices

### Retainer Time Tracking

**Setup:** Client has 40-hour monthly retainer at $150/hour
**During month:** Track all time → Monitor approaching limit → Notify client as needed
**End of month:** Review total hours → Create invoice → Add all time for month → Send invoice
**Overage:** Invoice separately or roll over per agreement

## Troubleshooting

**Timer not starting:** Ensure client is selected, check browser permissions, stop any other active timers.

**Time entry missing:** Clear filters (date, client, billable status) and search by description.

**Can't edit billed time:** Time is linked to invoice. Remove from invoice first (if draft) or leave as-is to maintain accuracy.

**Time not appearing in "Add to Invoice":** Verify time is unbilled, for selected client, and marked as billable.
