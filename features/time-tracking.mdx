## Converting Time to Invoices

### Adding Time to Invoices

The main benefit of time tracking: Easy invoicing!

**To Convert Time to Invoice:**

1. Create new invoice
2. Select client
3. Click **Add from Time Tracking**
4. See list of unbilled time records for this client
5. Select time records to include
6. Click **Add Selected**
7. Time records become invoice line items:
   - Description from time record
   - Hours as quantity
   - Hourly rate
   - Total = hours × rate
8. Time records marked as **Billed**

**Automatic Calculation:**
```
Time Record: Website Development, 5.5 hours @ $150/hour
Invoice Line Item:
  Description: Website Development
  Quantity: 5.5
  Rate: $150
  Total: $825
```

<Tip>
  Time tracking makes invoicing incredibly fast. Just select unbilled time and everything calculates automatically!
</Tip>

### Batch Invoicing

Invoice multiple time records at once:

**Monthly Billing Example:**
1. Track time all month for Client A
2. End of month: Create invoice
3. Select Client A
4. Add from Time Tracking
5. Select all unbilled time for the month
6. Add to invoice
7. All time converted to line items
8. Review total
9. Send invoice

**Single Invoice from Multiple Time Records:**
```
Time Record 1: Strategy Meeting, 2 hours
Time Record 2: Development, 8 hours
Time Record 3: Code Review, 3 hours
Time Record 4: Client Call, 1 hour

Invoice Line Items:
- Strategy Meeting: 2 hrs × $150 = $300
- Development: 8 hrs × $150 = $1,200
- Code Review: 3 hrs × $150 = $450
- Client Call: 1 hr × $150 = $150
Total: $2,100
```

### Marking Time as Billed

**Automatic Marking:**
- When you add time to invoice, status changes to **Billed**
- Linked to specific invoice
- Removed from unbilled time list
- Cannot be added to another invoice

**Unbilling Time:**

## Troubleshooting

### Timer Not Starting

**Check:**
- Client selected
- Browser permissions (if needed)
- Not already running another timer

**Solution:**
- Ensure client selected from dropdown
- Try refreshing page
- Stop any other active timers

### Time Entry Missing

**Check:**
- Date filter on time list
- Client filter
- Billable/non-billable filter
- Search function

**Solution:**
- Clear all filters
- Search by client or description
- Check if accidentally deleted

### Can't Edit Billed Time

**Reason:** Time linked to invoice, editing would change invoice

**Solution:**
- Remove time from invoice first (if invoice is draft)
- Or leave as-is to maintain invoice accuracy
- Future invoices will use correct rate

### Time Not Appearing in "Add to Invoice"

**Check:**
- Time is unbilled (not already invoiced)
- Time is for selected client
- Time is marked as billable (not non-billable)

**Solution:**
- Verify time record client matches invoice client
- Check billing status
- Ensure not already added to different invoice
