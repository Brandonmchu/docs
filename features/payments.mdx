## Overview

Every AI supports both online credit card payments through Stripe and manual payment tracking for offline payment methods. All payments are automatically linked to invoices, updating invoice status and maintaining accurate payment records.

## Payment Methods

### Online Payments (Stripe)

Accept major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover) directly on invoice pages.

**How It Works:** Connect Stripe account → Create invoice with online payments enabled → Client opens invoice page → Clicks Pay Now → Enters card details (secure Stripe form) → Payment processes instantly → Invoice marked Paid automatically → Both parties receive confirmation

**Processing Fees:** Typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (automatically deducted before deposit)

<Tip>
  Clients pay significantly faster when they can pay with a credit card immediately!
</Tip>

### Manual Payment Methods

**Supported Methods:** Cash, Check, Bank Transfer (wire/ACH/EFT), Credit Card (processed elsewhere), Other

**Recording:** Open invoice → Click Record Payment → Enter amount, date, method, optional notes/reference → Save (invoice status updates automatically)

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Record manual payments:
  - "Record a $5,000 check payment from ACME Corp"
  - "Mark invoice INV-123 as paid by bank transfer"
</Tip>

## Stripe Integration

### Setting Up Stripe

**Requirements:** Business bank account, business information, government ID, tax information

**Setup:** Settings → Payments → Connect Stripe Account → Complete Stripe onboarding (business details, bank account, identity verification, tax info) → Return to Every AI

**Timeline:** Basic setup 5-10 minutes, full verification 1-3 business days (can accept payments during verification)

<Note>
  You can accept payments even if your Stripe account is still under review. Payouts may be delayed until verification is complete.
</Note>

### Stripe Account Status

| Status | Description | Can Accept Payments? |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Enabled** | Fully operational, payouts active | Yes |
| **Payouts Disabled** | Payout setup incomplete | Yes |
| **Restricted** | Account under review, may need more info | Contact Stripe |
| **Not Connected** | Stripe not set up yet | No |

<Tip>
  Both "Enabled" and "Payouts Disabled" allow clients to pay invoices online!
</Tip>

### Managing Stripe Connection

**View Status:** Settings → Payments → See current status, account details, access Stripe dashboard

**Disconnect:** Settings → Payments → Disconnect Stripe → Confirm (online payments disabled, historical records preserved)

**Reconnect:** Follow setup process again with same or different Stripe account

### Stripe Payouts

Payments collect in Stripe balance → Automatic payout to bank account (usually daily, 2-7 business days processing). View payout status, fee breakdowns, and statements in Stripe dashboard. Manage payout schedule and bank account in Stripe dashboard.

## Payment Tracking

### Recording Manual Payments

Open invoice (must be issued) → Click Record Payment → Enter amount (full or partial), payment date (defaults to today, can backdate), payment method (Cash, Check, Bank Transfer, Credit Card, Other), reference/notes (check #, transaction ID, etc.) → Save Payment

**Result:** Payment record created, invoice status updated (Paid/Partial/Unpaid), outstanding balance recalculated, activity timeline updated

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Record detailed payments:
  - "Record a $3,000 partial payment from ACME Corp on invoice INV-123"
  - "Add a bank transfer payment of $10,000 received yesterday"
  - "Mark check #4567 for $2,500 from Tech Solutions as received"
</Tip>

### Partial Payments

Record first partial payment → Invoice shows "Paid $X of $Y" with outstanding balance → Status: Partially Paid → Record additional payments → Once fully paid, status changes to Paid

**Example:** Invoice $1,000 → Payment 1: $500 (Partially Paid, balance $500) → Payment 2: $500 (Paid, balance $0)

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Handle partial payments:
  - "Record the first installment of $1,000 from ACME Corp"
  - "Record the final payment of $3,000 to complete invoice INV-456"
</Tip>

### Payment History

View all payment records per invoice in the Payments section (date, amount, method, who recorded it, reference/notes, timestamp). Click payment for full details.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** View payment history:
  - "Show me all payments received this month"
  - "List payments from ACME Corp"
</Tip>

### Automatic Payment Notifications

When clients pay online via Stripe, both parties automatically receive email notifications with invoice number, client, amount, date/time, payment method, and transaction ID.

<Tip>
  Set up email notifications in Settings to ensure you're always notified of payments!
</Tip>

## Client Payment Claims

Clients can report payments they've made, which you approve or reject.

**How It Works:** Client views invoice → Clicks **Confirm Payment** → Chooses payment type, optional reference, and note → You receive notification → Review claim → Approve (creates payment record automatically) or Reject (request more info)

**Benefits:** Client-initiated payment tracking, reduced back-and-forth, audit trail, you maintain control

**Managing Claims:** Navigate to Payments/Invoices → See pending claims badge → Review details → Approve (verify payment received, check amount) or Reject (add reason) → Client notified

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage payment claims:
  - "Approve the payment claim from ACME Corp"
  - "Show me all pending payment claims"
</Tip>

## Payment Status & Invoice Updates

Invoice status auto-updates based on payments:

| Status Change | Trigger |
|--------------|---------|
| Unpaid → Paid | Full payment recorded (balance = $0) |
| Unpaid → Partially Paid | Partial payment recorded (balance > $0) |
| Overdue → Paid | Late full payment received |
| Partially Paid → Paid | Final payment completes balance |

**Outstanding Balance:** Total invoice amount - all payments recorded (updates automatically with each payment)

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Check outstanding balances:
  - "Which invoices are still waiting for payment?"
  - "What's the total outstanding balance across all clients?"
</Tip>

## Deleting Payments

Navigate to invoice → Find payment in Payments section → Click payment → Delete Payment → Confirm

**Result:** Payment record removed, outstanding balance recalculated, invoice status updated, activity timeline updated (cannot delete Stripe payments - refund through Stripe instead)

<Warning>
  Only delete payments recorded in error. For refunds, process through Stripe dashboard or record negative adjustment.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Delete incorrect payments:
  - "Delete the payment I just recorded on invoice INV-123"
  - "Remove the incorrect payment from ACME Corp invoice"
</Tip>

## Payment Reporting

### Payment List View

View all payments across all invoices with:
- **Summary cards** for payment count and total amount received (click to filter the table)
- **Search** across payment amounts, invoices, or clients
- **Row selection** to send payment confirmation emails or delete manual entries in bulk

**Summary Metrics:** Payments received count, total amount received

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** View payment reports:
  - "Show me all payments received in Q4"
  - "What's the total amount received this year?"
  - "Show payments for ACME Corp sorted by date"
</Tip>

### Payment Analytics

Deeper analytics (average days to payment, on-time rate, method breakdowns, revenue trends) live in **Reports → Payment Time/Revenue**. Use those reports—or ask Every Agent—to pull the aggregated metrics while the Payments page focuses on day-to-day operations.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Analyze payment patterns:
  - "Run the payment time report for ACME Corp"
  - "What's our most common payment method last quarter?"
  - "How much revenue did we receive in December?"
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Enable online payments** - Clients pay 5-10x faster when they can pay by credit card immediately.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Record payments promptly with references** - Update invoices as soon as payments are received. Add check numbers or transaction IDs to track in your bank account.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review payment claims and track partial payments carefully** - Verify payment actually received before approving claims. Record installments as you receive them.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Monitor Stripe dashboard** - Review payouts and transaction history regularly in Stripe.
</Tip>

## Common Workflows

**Online Payment:** Create invoice with online payments enabled → Send to client → Client opens page → Clicks Pay Now → Enters card details → Payment processes → Invoice marked Paid automatically → Both receive confirmation → Funds in Stripe balance → Automatic payout to bank

**Manual Check Payment:** Client mails check → You receive and deposit → Once cleared, open invoice → Record Payment with amount and check number → Select method: Check → Save → Invoice status updates to Paid

**Partial Payment:** Client pays first installment → Record first payment (partial) → Invoice shows Partially Paid with balance → Client pays second installment → Record second payment → Continue until fully paid (balance = $0, status = Paid)

## Troubleshooting

**Client Can't Pay Online:** Verify Stripe connected and active → Check invoice has online payments enabled and is issued (not draft) → Resend invoice link → Ask client to try different card or offer alternative payment method

**Payment Not Showing in Bank Account:** Check payout schedule in Stripe dashboard (standard 2-7 business days) → Verify bank account connected correctly → Check for Stripe holds or reviews → Contact Stripe support if delayed

**Wrong Payment Amount Recorded:** Delete incorrect payment record → Record new payment with correct amount → Verify invoice status updated correctly

**Invoice Still Shows Unpaid After Recording:** Verify payment amount matches invoice total → Refresh page → Check payment record exists and was saved to correct invoice → Contact support if issue persists
