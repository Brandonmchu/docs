## Overview

Contacts are the **people** in your business world - everyone from active client contacts to potential leads you met at a conference. Unlike [Clients](/features/clients) (which represent companies or businesses), Contacts represent individuals.

**Key capabilities:**
- Store contact details (name, email, phone, job title)
- Import from [LinkedIn](https://every.ai/contacts) and [Google Contacts](https://every.ai/contacts)
- Link contacts to one or more [clients](/features/clients) with role-based email routing
- AI-powered enrichment and relationship summaries
- Google Contacts sync for duplicate detection

## Creating Contacts

Go to [**Contacts**](https://every.ai/contacts) → **Add Contact** → Fill details → **Save**

**Required:** Name
**Recommended:** Email address (needed for invoicing and proposals)
**Optional:** Phone, job title, notes

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create contacts quickly:
  - "Create a contact named John Smith with email john@acme.com"
  - "Add a contact Sarah Johnson, CFO at TechStart, email sarah@techstart.com"
  - "Create a contact for the person I met at the conference - Mike Chen, mike@startup.io"
</Tip>

## Importing Contacts

Every supports multiple ways to bulk-import contacts into your network.

### LinkedIn Import

Import your LinkedIn connections directly from a CSV export, with optional AI relationship summaries from your message history.

**How to import:**
1. Go to [**Contacts**](https://every.ai/contacts) → **Import** dropdown → **LinkedIn**
2. Upload your `Connections.csv` file (exported from LinkedIn)
3. Preview new contacts (duplicates are auto-filtered)
4. Click **Import**

**What gets imported:** Name, email (if available), job title, company (in notes), LinkedIn profile URL

<Tip>
  **Optional:** After importing, upload your LinkedIn `Messages.csv` to generate AI-powered relationship timelines showing your history with each contact.
</Tip>

<Note>
  See [Import Data](/data/csv-import) for full LinkedIn export instructions and details on AI relationship summaries.
</Note>

### Google Contacts Import

Import your entire Google Contacts library with one click.

**How to import:**
1. Go to [**Contacts**](https://every.ai/contacts) → **Import** dropdown → **Google Contacts**
2. Authorize Google Contacts access if not already connected
3. Preview new vs. existing contacts
4. Click **Import**

**What gets imported:** Name, email, phone, organization, social URLs (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)

<Note>
  Google Contacts **Import** brings in all your contacts. The **Scan Contacts** workflow on the Home dashboard is different - it uses AI to identify which contacts look like potential business clients.
</Note>

### Scan Contacts (AI-Powered)

Let Every Agent analyze your Gmail, Calendar, and Google Contacts to suggest contacts that look like business leads.

**How it works:**
1. On the [**Home**](https://every.ai) dashboard → **Import Data** card → **Scan Contacts**
2. Every Agent scans recent email, calendar, and contact activity
3. Review suggested contacts and select ones to add
4. Contacts are created with context from your interactions

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Scan my Google contacts and add any that look like potential clients"
</Tip>

## Linking Contacts to Clients

Contacts exist independently but can be **linked to one or more [clients](/features/clients)** with role-based email routing. This means the same contact can be associated with multiple client companies.

### How Linking Works

When you link a contact to a client, you assign roles that control email routing:

**Invoice Role:**
- **Primary (TO):** Receives the main invoice email - exactly one required per client
- **CC:** Copied on invoice emails - can have multiple
- **None:** Not included in invoice emails

**Proposal Role:**
- **Primary (TO):** Receives the main proposal email
- **CC:** Copied on proposal emails
- **None:** Not included

**Example Setup:**
```
ACME Corp (Client) Contacts:
├── John Smith (CEO)
│   └── Invoices: CC | Proposals: Primary
├── Sarah Johnson (CFO)
│   └── Invoices: Primary | Proposals: CC
└── Accounts Team
    └── Invoices: CC | Proposals: None
```

### Linking from Client Page

1. Open a [client](https://every.ai/clients) → **Edit** → **Add Contact**
2. Search for an existing contact or create a new one
3. Set invoice and proposal roles
4. First contact defaults to Primary for both

### Linking via Agent

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage contact-client links:
  - "Link John Smith to ACME Corp as the primary invoice contact"
  - "Add Sarah as a CC on proposals for TechStart Inc"
  - "Show me all contacts linked to ACME Corp"
  - "Set the billing team contact as CC on invoices for all enterprise clients"
</Tip>

<Note>
  You must have exactly one Primary (TO) contact per document type on each client. You cannot have CC recipients without a Primary.
</Note>

## Contact Enrichment

AI-powered enrichment helps fill in contact details automatically.

**During client enrichment:** When you [enrich a client](/features/clients#client-enrichment), Every Agent can discover additional contacts at the company by scanning Gmail headers and Google Contacts for matching email domains.

**Google Contacts sync:** Every tracks which of your contacts exist in team members' Google Contacts. A sync indicator shows on matching contacts.

## Managing Contacts

### Viewing & Filtering

Go to [**Contacts**](https://every.ai/contacts) to see all contacts with:
- Search by name, email, company, phone
- Filter by linked clients
- Sort by name, date added, or recent activity

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Find contacts:
  - "Find the contact John Smith"
  - "Show me all contacts at acme.com"
  - "List contacts I added this month"
  - "Who are the contacts linked to ACME Corp?"
</Tip>

### Editing Contacts

Open contact → **Edit** → Update fields → **Save**

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Update contact details:
  - "Update John Smith's email to john.smith@newcompany.com"
  - "Change Sarah's job title to VP of Finance"
  - "Add phone number 555-1234 to the contact Mike Chen"
</Tip>

### Archiving & Deleting

**Archive:** Hides contact from active list while preserving data and links. Can be restored anytime.

**Delete:** Permanently removes the contact. Only possible if not linked as a Primary recipient on any client.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Archive or delete:
  - "Archive the contact Old Contact Name"
  - "Delete the test contact I just created"
</Tip>

### Social & Web Links

Add LinkedIn profiles, websites, and other social links to contacts for quick reference.

**Supported Links:** Website, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, GitHub

<Tip>
  Social links are often populated automatically during import (LinkedIn URLs) or enrichment.
</Tip>

## Contacts vs. Clients

Understanding the distinction:

| | Contacts | Clients |
|---|---|---|
| **Represents** | People (individuals) | Companies/businesses |
| **Examples** | John Smith, Sarah Johnson | ACME Corp, TechStart Inc |
| **Relationship** | Can be linked to multiple clients | Has multiple contacts linked |
| **Primary use** | Email routing, relationship tracking | Invoicing, proposals, billing |
| **Import from** | LinkedIn, Google Contacts | Manual, Google scan, enrichment |

```
Contact (Person)                    Client (Company)
├── John Smith ──────────────────── ACME Corp
│   ├── email: john@acme.com        ├── Invoices
│   ├── title: CEO                   ├── Proposals
│   └── roles:                       ├── Time Tracking
│       ├── ACME: Invoice CC         ├── Expenses
│       └── ACME: Proposal Primary   └── Automations
│
├── Sarah Johnson ───────────────── ACME Corp
│   └── roles:                       (same client, different roles)
│       └── ACME: Invoice Primary
│
└── Mike Chen ───────────────────── TechStart Inc
    └── roles:                       (different client entirely)
        └── TechStart: Invoice Primary
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Import early** - Bring in your LinkedIn and Google contacts to build your network in Every from day one.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Set roles carefully** - Ensure each client has exactly one Primary invoice contact for reliable email delivery.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Keep contacts updated** - When people change roles or companies, update their contact info and client links.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use AI summaries** - Upload LinkedIn Messages.csv after import for valuable relationship context.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

**Contact not receiving invoices:** Verify the contact is linked to the client with a Primary or CC invoice role. Check email address is correct.

**Duplicate contacts after import:** System checks by email for duplicates. If imported from multiple sources (LinkedIn + Google), merge manually or ask Every Agent.

**Can't delete contact:** Contact may be set as Primary recipient on a client. Set another contact as Primary first.

**LinkedIn import missing emails:** Many LinkedIn users don't share email addresses. Contacts are still imported by name - enrich later to find contact details.
