## Overview

Invoices are the core of Every. Create professional, branded invoices, send them to clients, track delivery and opens, accept payments, and manage your entire billing lifecycle.

## Invoice Workflow States

Every invoice moves through defined states during its lifecycle:

| Status | Description | Key Features |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Draft** | Work in progress | Not sent, fully editable, not visible to client |
| **Issued** | Sent to client | Payment pending, email delivered, public page available |
| **Paid** | Payment received | Full amount paid, balance = $0, automatically updated |
| **Overdue** | Past due date | No payment received, shown in red, needs follow-up |
| **Void** | Cancelled | No payment expected, preserved for records, cannot be un-voided |

<Note>
  Invoice status updates automatically based on due dates and payments received.
</Note>

## Creating Invoices

<Note>
  **Required to Create an Invoice:**
  - **Client** (select from existing clients; create clients first if needed)
  - **At least one line item** (from offerings, manual entry, time records, or expenses)

  All other fields (payment terms, notes, attachments) are optional.
</Note>

### Basic Invoice Creation

Go to Invoices → Create Invoice → Select client → Add line items → Set payment terms → Save as Draft or Send

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create invoices with natural language:
  - "Create an invoice for ACME Corp for $5,000"
  - "Make a draft invoice for Tech Solutions with 20 hours of consulting at $150/hour"
  - "Invoice Client ABC for the web design project we discussed"
</Tip>

### Invoice Components

#### Client Selection

**Required**: Every invoice must have a client.

- Select from existing clients
- Client info appears on invoice:
  - Name
  - Email (invoice delivery)
  - Address
  - CC emails (if set up)
- Can't change client after invoice is issued

<Tip>
  If you need to invoice someone new, add them as a client first!
</Tip>

#### Line Items

**Line Item Fields:** Description, quantity, rate, tax (optional), total (auto-calculated)

**Adding Line Items:**
- **From Offerings** (Recommended): Select offering → Details auto-fill → Adjust quantity
- **Manual Entry**: Add line item → Enter description, quantity, rate, tax
- **From Time Records**: Select unbilled time → Converts to line items (hours × rate) → Marked as billed
- **From Expenses**: Select billable expenses → Becomes line items → Marked as billed

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Add line items easily:
  - "Add 10 hours of consulting to the invoice for Client ABC"
  - "Add my unbilled time from last month to this invoice"
  - "Include the web design service from my offerings at $2,500"
  - "Add all billable expenses for ACME Corp to their invoice"
</Tip>

#### Financial Details

**Calculation**: Subtotal - Discount + Tax = Total Amount Due (all automatic)

**Tax**: Applied per line item or to entire invoice with configurable rate

**Discounts**: Percentage (10%, 15%) or fixed amount ($50, $100) applied to subtotal before tax

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Apply discounts to invoices:
  - "Apply a 10% discount to the invoice for returning customer"
  - "Give ACME Corp a $500 discount on their invoice"
</Tip>

#### Payment Terms

- **Issue Date**: Defaults to today, can be backdated
- **Due Date**: Auto-calculated from org defaults or set manually (determines overdue status)
- **Reference/PO Number**: Client's purchase order or project reference (optional)
- **Online Payments**: Enable Stripe "Pay Now" button per invoice

<Tip>
  Set realistic due dates. Net 30 (30 days) is industry standard for most services.
</Tip>

#### Notes & Terms

Add custom notes for payment instructions, terms, or thank you messages. Organization defaults auto-fill and can be edited per invoice.

**Example:** "Thank you for your business! Payment is due within 30 days. Late payments subject to 1.5% monthly interest."

#### Attachments

Upload PDFs, images, Word docs, or Excel files (up to 5MB each). Attachments are visible and downloadable by clients on the public invoice page. Common uses: contracts, work samples, terms, specifications.

### Currency Selection

Select USD or CAD per invoice (defaults to organization currency). Useful for mixed client bases in both countries.

<Note>
  Currency cannot be changed after invoice is issued.
</Note>

### Templates & Branding

Choose from Modern, Classic, Professional, or Creative templates. Organization logo, brand colors, and styling apply automatically. Override default template per invoice if needed.

### Scheduled Sends

Queue invoices to send automatically on a future date/time instead of sending immediately. Perfect for timing invoices to align with project milestones, client billing cycles, or month-end cadences.

#### How to Schedule an Invoice

**Option 1: When Creating Invoice**
1. Complete invoice details
2. Instead of "Send Invoice", click "Schedule Send"
3. Choose date and time (your local timezone)
4. Click "Schedule"
5. Invoice saves as Draft with send scheduled

**Option 2: Schedule Existing Draft**
1. Open draft invoice
2. Click "Schedule Send"
3. Select future date/time
4. Confirm

**Option 3: Ask Every Agent**
```
"Schedule invoice INV-123 to send on January 1st at 9:00 AM"
"Send the ACME Corp invoice next Monday morning"
"Schedule this invoice for the first of next month"
```

#### Managing Scheduled Sends

**View All Scheduled:**
- Go to Invoices → Filter by "Scheduled"
- Or ask Every Agent: "Show me all scheduled invoices"

Each scheduled invoice displays:
- Client name
- Invoice amount
- Scheduled send date/time
- Status: "Scheduled for [date]"

**Edit Scheduled Time:**
1. Open invoice with scheduled send
2. Click "Update Schedule"
3. Choose new date/time
4. Save changes

**Cancel Scheduled Send:**
1. Open invoice
2. Click "Cancel Schedule"
3. Invoice remains as Draft
4. You can send immediately or schedule for different time

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage scheduled sends:
  - "Cancel the scheduled send for invoice INV-123"
  - "Reschedule the ACME Corp invoice for next Friday"
  - "Show me all invoices scheduled to send this week"
  - "What invoices are scheduled to go out today?"
</Tip>

#### What Happens at Send Time

When the scheduled time arrives:
1. System automatically sends invoice
2. Email delivered to client (and CC recipients)
3. Status changes to "Issued"
4. Public invoice page created
5. Email tracking begins
6. You receive confirmation notification

**If client details changed:** Updated information is used at send time (not when scheduled)

#### Best Practices

**Use Cases:**
- **Monthly billing cycles:** Schedule all invoices for 1st of month
- **Project milestones:** Send when work completes
- **Time-sensitive billing:** Align with contract start dates
- **Batch processing:** Create all invoices now, schedule for optimal send times

<Tip>
  **Optimal send times** - Tuesday-Thursday mornings (9-11am client timezone) tend to have highest engagement
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Invoices scheduled for past dates will send immediately when the schedule is created.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Check before scheduled time** - Review draft one more time before scheduled send in case client details changed
</Tip>

## Sending Invoices

### Sending Process

Review invoice → Check client email → Preview → Click Send Invoice

**What Happens:** Email sent to client (and CC recipients), status changes to Issued, public invoice page created, email tracking begins. Email contains PDF attachment, public page link, and payment instructions.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Send invoices to clients:
  - "Send invoice INV-123 to the client"
  - "Send the ACME Corp invoice now"
</Tip>

### Email Delivery Tracking

Track delivery, opens, clicks, bounces, and spam reports with timestamps in the Email Activity section. Use this to time follow-ups and identify delivery issues.

<Tip>
  Wait to follow up until you see the client opened the email. No need to bother them before they've seen it!
</Tip>

### Resending Invoices

Open invoice → Click Resend Invoice → Add message (optional) → Send. Creates new email event with separate tracking while preserving full history.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Resend invoices:
  - "Resend invoice INV-123 to the client"
  - "Send a reminder for the ACME Corp invoice"
</Tip>

## Public Invoice Pages

Every issued invoice has a secure, branded public page with full invoice details, organization branding, line items, payment terms, downloadable attachments, and Pay Now button (if Stripe connected). Mobile-responsive, print-friendly, with unique non-guessable URL.

**Payment Flow:** Client opens page → Clicks Pay Now → Enters card details → Payment processes → Invoice marked Paid automatically → Confirmation sent to both parties

## Managing Invoices

### Invoice List View

**Features:** Summary cards (total, paid, overdue), filters (status, client, date range), search (invoice number, client, amount), sort options, bulk actions (send, archive, delete)

**Status Filters:** All, Drafts, Issued (unpaid), Paid, Overdue, Void

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** View and filter invoices:
  - "Show me all draft invoices"
  - "List all overdue invoices"
  - "Show invoices for ACME Corp from last month"
</Tip>

### Editing Invoices

**Draft Invoices:** Edit freely - change any field, add/remove line items, update client

**Issued Invoices:** Limited editing - can't change amounts or client, but can add attachments/notes and record payments

<Warning>
  Once an invoice is issued, major changes are restricted. Create a new invoice or void the old one if significant changes are needed.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Edit draft invoices:
  - "Update the invoice for ACME Corp to $6,000"
  - "Change the due date on invoice INV-123 to next Friday"
</Tip>

### Voiding Invoices

Open invoice → Click Void Invoice → Add reason (optional) → Confirm

**Result:** Status changes to Void, removed from outstanding balances, hidden from overdue list, preserved in history (cannot be un-voided)

**When to Void:** Client cancelled project, invoice created in error, service not provided, replaced by new invoice

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Void invoices:
  - "Void invoice INV-123"
  - "Cancel the invoice for XYZ Company"
</Tip>

### Duplicating Invoices

Open invoice → Click Duplicate Invoice → New draft created with same client, line items, notes, terms → Adjust as needed → Send

**Use Cases:** Recurring manual invoicing, similar projects for same client, template for similar services

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Duplicate invoices:
  - "Duplicate invoice INV-123 for next month"
  - "Create a copy of the ACME Corp invoice"
</Tip>

### Archiving Invoices

Select invoices → Click Archive bulk action → Invoices hidden from main view (still accessible via filter, included in reports, can be restored)

**When to Archive:** Old paid invoices, completed projects, end of fiscal year cleanup

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Archive old invoices:
  - "Archive all paid invoices from last year"
  - "Move all 2024 paid invoices to archive"
</Tip>

## Invoice Attachments

Create/edit invoice → Find Attachments section → Add Attachment → Select file → Upload (max 5MB per file, multiple supported)

Files stored securely in cloud storage, accessible to you always and to clients via public invoice page. URLs expire for security.

**Common Uses:** Service agreements, work orders, project specifications, design mockups, proof of work, terms and conditions

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage invoice attachments:
  - "Attach the contract to invoice INV-123"
  - "Add the signed agreement to the ACME Corp invoice"
</Tip>

## Invoice Activity Timeline

Complete chronological history of all invoice events (created, edited, sent, delivered, opened, clicked, payment received, voided, notes/attachments added) with timestamps, actor, and event details. Filterable and exportable for audit trails and dispute support.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Complete organization setup first** - Logo, branding, and defaults make invoices professional.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use offerings and enable online payments** - Pre-defined services speed up creation, and online payment options help clients pay significantly faster.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Set clear due dates and detailed line items** - Net 30 is standard. Clear descriptions reduce client questions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Track email opens before follow-ups** - Use scheduled sends for optimal timing and wait to follow up until clients have seen the invoice.
</Tip>

## Common Workflows

**Standard Invoicing:** Create invoice → Select client → Add line items from offerings → Review totals → Add notes/attachments → Send → Track delivery/opens → Receive payment → Record (or automatic if Stripe)

**Time-Based Invoicing:** Track time during work period → Create invoice at billing cycle → Add time records as line items → Review hours/rates → Send → Time records marked as billed

**Expense Billback Invoicing:** Log expenses throughout project → Mark as billable → Create invoice → Add billable expenses as line items → Include other services → Send → Expenses marked as billed

## Troubleshooting

**Invoice Not Sending:** Verify client email address, check internet connection, try resending, check email delivery status in invoice activity

**Client Didn't Receive Invoice:** Check email delivery status → Verify email address → Ask client to check spam → Resend invoice or send public invoice link directly

**Can't Edit Issued Invoice:** Invoices are locked after sending for protection. Void and create new invoice, or record payment adjustment if minor change needed

**Wrong Total Calculation:** Review each line item, verify tax applied correctly per line item, check discount applied correctly, ensure no duplicate line items
