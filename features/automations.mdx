## Overview

Invoice Automations (Recurring Invoices) automatically generate and send invoices on a schedule. Perfect for clients you bill regularly - monthly retainers, quarterly services, annual subscriptions, or any recurring billing need.

<Note>
  **Save Time:** Set up once, automate forever. Ideal for recurring clients and predictable billing cycles.
</Note>

### Adding Line Items to Automations

Line items work the same as regular invoices:

**From Offerings:**
1. Click **Add Line Item**
2. Select offering
3. Set quantity
4. Automatic rate and tax

**Manual Entry:**
1. Click **Add Line Item**
2. Enter description
3. Set quantity and rate
4. Apply tax if needed

**Best Practice:**
Use offerings for consistency across all generated invoices!

### Action on Generation

**Create as Draft:**
- Invoice generated but not sent
- Appears in your drafts
- You review before sending
- Can edit amounts or notes
- Send manually when ready

**Use when:**
- Want to review before sending
- Amounts may vary slightly
- Need to add notes per invoice
- Testing new automation

**Send Immediately:**
- Invoice generated and emailed automatically
- No manual intervention
- Client receives invoice right away
- Status: Issued

**Use when:**
- Same amount every time
- Trust automation completely
- Want fully hands-off billing
- Established automation

<Warning>
  Only use "Send Immediately" for well-tested automations with established clients!
</Warning>

## Testing Automations

Before activating an automation for real, test it!

### Test Mode

**How Test Mode Works:**

1. Edit automation
2. Enable **Test Mode**
3. Automation generates test invoices:
   - Prefixed with "TEST-"
   - Sent to your email (not client)
   - Doesn't affect production data
   - Uses actual automation code
4. Review test invoice
5. Verify:
   - Correct amounts
   - Correct line items
   - Correct formatting
   - Correct branding
6. Disable test mode when ready
7. Activate automation for real

**Test Invoice Characteristics:**
- Invoice number: TEST-001, TEST-002, etc.
- Email recipient: Your email (organization owner)
- Not visible to client
- Can be deleted without constraints
- Full automation logic tested

<Tip>
  Always test automations before going live, especially "Send Immediately" automations!
</Tip>

### Safe Testing

**Test mode is safe because:**
- No emails to clients
- Test invoices clearly marked
- Easy cleanup (just delete test invoices)
- Tests real code paths
- Verifies entire workflow

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Line items correct?
- [ ] Amounts accurate?
- [ ] Tax calculated correctly?
- [ ] Invoice formatting good?
- [ ] Branding applied?
- [ ] Email would go to right client (if not test)?
- [ ] Schedule correct?

Once checklist complete, disable test mode and activate!

## Managing Automations

### Activating Automations

**To Activate:**
1. Create automation (or edit existing)
2. Set status to **Active**
3. Save automation

**Active automation:**
- Runs on schedule
- Generates invoices automatically
- Next run date calculated
- Execution history tracked

### Deactivating Automations

**To Deactivate:**
1. Edit automation
2. Set status to **Inactive**
3. Save automation

**Inactive automation:**
- Does not run
- Schedule paused
- No invoices generated
- Can be reactivated anytime
- Historical data preserved

**When to Deactivate:**
- Client contract ended
- Temporary billing pause
- Need to update automation
- Testing changes

### Next Run Date

System automatically calculates when automation runs next:

**Calculation:**
- Based on schedule type
- From last execution (or start date if never run)
- Shown on automation detail page
- Updates after each run

**Example:**
```
Schedule: Monthly (1st of month)
Last Run: March 1, 2025
Next Run: April 1, 2025
```

### Execution History

Complete record of every invoice generated:

**History Includes:**
- Execution date and time
- Invoice generated (link)
- Success or failure
- Error messages (if failed)
- Who it was sent to
- Action taken (draft or sent)

**Access History:**
1. Open automation
2. View **Execution History** section
3. Click execution for details

**Benefits:**
- Audit trail of all automated invoices
- Troubleshoot failures
- Verify correct operation
- Track automation performance

## Automation Features

### Date Range Control

**Start Date:**
- First invoice generated on/after start date
- Required field

**End Date (Optional):**
- Automation stops after this date
- Useful for fixed-term contracts
- Leave blank for ongoing

**Example:**
```
Start Date: January 1, 2025
End Date: December 31, 2025
Result: 12 monthly invoices generated in 2025,
       then automation stops
```

### Error Handling

If automation fails, system:

**Graceful Failure:**
- Logs error in execution history
- Sends notification to organization owner
- Does NOT generate invoice (prevents bad invoices)
- Automation stays active
- Will retry on next scheduled run

**Common Errors:**
- Client no longer exists (archived/deleted)
- Organization settings incomplete
- Email service temporarily down
- System maintenance

**Resolution:**
- Check error message in execution history
- Fix underlying issue (restore client, complete settings, etc.)
- Automation will run successfully next time

<Note>
  Automations fail safely - no incorrect invoices are ever generated or sent.
</Note>

### Template and Branding

Automated invoices use:
- Organization logo
- Brand colors
- Selected invoice template
- Default currency
- Default due days
- Organization address

Everything from organization settings applied automatically!

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Test before activating** - Always run test mode to verify automation works correctly.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use offerings** - Reference offerings in line items for consistency across generated invoices.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Start with drafts** - Use "Create as Draft" until you're confident, then switch to "Send Immediately".
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Set end dates for fixed contracts** - Prevents billing after contract ends.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review execution history regularly** - Catch any issues early.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Deactivate when not needed** - Pause automations for seasonal clients or temporary stops.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Clear naming** - Name automations clearly: "ACME Corp - Monthly Retainer" not just "ACME Corp".
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Automation Not Running

**Check:**
- Automation status is Active (not Inactive)
- Next run date hasn't passed yet
- Start date is in past
- End date hasn't passed (if set)
- Client still exists and is active

**Solution:**
- Activate automation if inactive
- Check next run date
- Verify client status
- Review execution history for errors

### Test Invoice Not Generated

**Check:**
- Test mode enabled
- Automation saved after enabling test mode
- Manually trigger test (if button available)
- Organization email configured

**Solution:**
- Re-enable test mode
- Save automation
- Wait a moment and check drafts
- Check spam folder for test email

### Wrong Amount on Generated Invoice

**Check:**
- Line item amounts in automation
- Tax settings
- Discount applied
- Offerings referenced have correct rates

**Solution:**
- Edit automation
- Update line item amounts
- Verify offerings
- Test again before next run

### Invoice Sent to Wrong Client

**Not possible** - Each automation tied to specific client. Cannot send to wrong client.

**If seeing this:**
- Multiple automations running
- Check which automation generated which invoice
- Review automation configurations

## Advanced Tips

### Multiple Automations Per Client

You can have multiple automations for the same client:

**Example:**
- Monthly retainer (1st of month)
- Quarterly audit (every 3 months on 15th)

Both run independently, both for same client.

### Combining with Manual Invoices

Automations don't prevent manual invoices:

- Automation generates recurring invoices
- You can still create one-off invoices manually
- Both appear in client's invoice history
- No conflicts

### Seasonal Automations

For seasonal businesses:

**Option 1: Use End Date**
- Set start and end for season
- Create new automation next season

**Option 2: Deactivate/Reactivate**
- Deactivate at season end
- Reactivate at season start
- Preserves configuration
