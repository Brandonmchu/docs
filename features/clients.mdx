## Overview

Clients are the customers you invoice for services. Manage contact information, track payment history, and organize customer relationships.

<Note>
  **Required for Invoices:** Create at least one client before sending invoices.
</Note>

**Key capabilities:**
- Store contact info (email, phone, address)
- Add CC email recipients for invoice copies
- AI-powered company enrichment
- Pull contacts from Google Workspace (inline suggestions + Scan Contacts workflow)
- Track payment history and invoices
- View complete activity timeline

## Creating Clients

Go to **Clients** → **Add Client** → Fill name and email → **Save**

**Required:** Client name
**Recommended:** Email address (needed for invoicing)
**Optional:** Phone, website, address

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create new clients instantly with natural language:
  - "Create a client named ACME Corp with email contact@acme.com"
  - "Add a new client for TechStart Inc, email is john@techstart.com, phone is 555-0123"
  - "Create a client called Sarah Johnson with email sarah@consulting.com and address 123 Main St, New York, NY 10001"
</Tip>

### CC Email Addresses

Add up to 2 additional recipients per client. All CC recipients receive invoice copies automatically.

**Common uses:** Accounting departments, project managers, decision-makers

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Set up CC emails for your clients:
  - "Add accounting@acmecorp.com as a CC email for ACME Corp"
  - "Update the client XYZ Company to CC sarah@xyz.com and john@xyz.com on invoices"
  - "Add billing@techstart.com as an additional recipient for TechStart Inc"
</Tip>

## Client Enrichment

AI-powered enrichment automatically finds and fills company information.

**How it works:** Open a client record → Click the **Actions** menu (⋯) → **Enrich Client**. Every Agent queries Gmail, Calendar, and public data via `/api/enrich-company`, then updates the client once you approve the toast.

**What gets enriched:** Company name, logo, website, address, industry info

<Tip>
  Works best for established businesses with web presence. May not find data for small businesses or individuals.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Trigger enrichment from chat:
  - "Create and enrich a client for Microsoft Corporation"
  - "Add XYZ Consulting as a client and pull their latest company information"
  - "Enrich the existing client Tesla Inc with updated company details"
</Tip>

## Google Contacts Integration

Bring Google Workspace context directly into client creation.

**Setup:** Settings → Integrations → Connect Google Account (grant Contacts plus Gmail/Calendar for best results)

**Two ways to use it:**
- **Inline suggestions:** When you type in the Email field on the client form, the Google Contacts search component appears and auto-fills the rest of the contact details you select.
- **Scan Contacts workflow:** On the **Home** dashboard, open the **Get Started** card → **Scan Contacts**. Google Contacts Analysis reviews recent Gmail, Calendar, and Contacts activity so you can select which suggested contacts to add as clients.

**What gets imported:** Name, email, phone, organization, notes (plus any extra context surfaced by the analysis)

<Note>
  Scans are on-demand, not continuous sync. Re-run **Scan Contacts** or ask Every Agent again when you want a fresh batch of suggestions. Duplicate clients are prevented via email matching.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Run the scan from chat:
  - "Scan my Google contacts and add likely clients"
  - "Review Google contacts tagged as clients and add them to Every"
  - "Show me Google contacts we haven't added yet"
</Tip>

## Client Features

### Client History

View complete activity timeline per client:
- Invoice history and status
- Proposal history and approvals
- Payment records
- Email tracking (sends, opens, clicks)

### Client Pipeline

Track deals and opportunities:
- Drag-and-drop pipeline stages (configure statuses in **Clients → Pipeline Settings**)
- Proposal badges on each card show stage and amount
- Quick actions for invoices, proposals, automations, time, and expenses
- HubSpot-sourced clients show HubSpot deal badges on the client detail page so you know which CRM owns the record

### Search & Filtering

**Search by:** Name, email, company, phone
**Filter by:** Active/archived, outstanding/overdue invoices, revenue
**Sort by:** Alphabetical, recent, revenue, invoice count

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Find and filter clients easily:
  - "Show me all clients with overdue invoices"
  - "Find clients with outstanding balances"
  - "List all archived clients"
  - "Show me clients I added this month"
  - "Find the client ACME Corp"
</Tip>

## Managing Clients

### Editing Client Information

Open client → **Edit Client** → Update fields → **Save Changes**

<Note>
  Changes don't affect existing invoices, only new ones.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Update client details quickly:
  - "Update ACME Corp's email to newemail@acme.com"
  - "Change the phone number for TechStart Inc to 555-9999"
  - "Update the address for client XYZ Company to 456 Oak Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102"
  - "Add website www.newsite.com to the client Beta Solutions"
</Tip>

### Archiving Clients

Archive inactive clients to hide them while preserving data.

**To archive:** Open client → **Archive Client** → Confirm

**Benefits:** Preserves history, maintains invoice integrity, can restore anytime

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Archive inactive clients:
  - "Archive the client ABC Inc"
  - "Mark TechStart Inc as archived"
  - "Archive all clients with no invoices in the last 12 months"
  - "Hide the client Old Company from my active list"
</Tip>

**To restore:** Filter archived → Open client → **Restore Client**

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Restore previously archived clients:
  - "Restore the archived client ABC Inc"
  - "Unarchive TechStart Inc"
  - "Reactivate the client Old Company"
</Tip>

### Deleting Clients

<Warning>
  Deleting permanently removes client. Only possible if no issued invoices exist.
</Warning>

**Requirements:** No issued invoices or outstanding payments

**Recommendation:** Archive instead to preserve history

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Delete clients (use with caution):
  - "Delete the draft client Test Company"
  - "Remove the client XYZ Corp that has no invoices"
  - "Permanently delete the client Sample Inc"
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Add complete info** for professional invoices • **Use enrichment** to save time • **Set CC emails** for team visibility • **Archive** instead of deleting
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

**Enrichment not finding data:** Try name variations, add website, or enter manually
**Can't delete client:** Archive instead (client has issued invoices)
**Duplicate imports:** System checks by email, merge manually if needed
**CC emails not working:** Verify addresses, check spam, ensure invoice was sent
