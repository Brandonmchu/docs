## Overview

Clients are the customers or businesses you provide services to and invoice. Every AI's client management system helps you organize customer information, track interaction history, and maintain professional relationships.

<Note>
  **Required for Invoices:** You must create at least one client before you can send invoices. Clients are the foundation of your billing workflow.
</Note>

## What Are Clients?

Clients in Every AI represent:
- **Individual customers** - Freelance clients, personal customers
- **Business customers** - Companies you provide services to
- **Recurring clients** - Customers you bill regularly
- **Project-based clients** - One-time or occasional customers

Each client can have:
- Contact information (email, phone, address)
- Multiple CC email recipients for invoice copies
- Company details and branding
- Payment history and outstanding balances
- Activity timeline of all interactions

## Creating Clients

### Basic Client Creation

1. Navigate to **Clients** in the main menu
2. Click **Add Client** or the **+** button
3. Fill in client information:

**Required Fields:**
- **Name**: Client or company name

**Optional but Recommended:**
- **Email**: Primary contact email (required for sending invoices)
- **Phone**: Contact phone number
- **Website**: Company website
- **Address**: Full address (street, city, state/province, postal code, country)

4. Click **Save**

<Tip>
  Add at least an email address so you can send invoices to the client!
</Tip>

### CC Email Addresses

Send invoice copies to additional recipients:

**CC Email 1 & CC Email 2:**
- Add up to 2 additional email addresses per client
- These recipients receive invoice copies automatically
- Useful for:
  - Accounting departments
  - Multiple decision-makers
  - Client project managers
  - Internal team members

**How CC Emails Work:**
- When you send an invoice, CC recipients get a copy
- They see the same invoice as the primary contact
- Email shows they're CC'd on the invoice
- Helps keep entire client teams informed

Example use case:
```
Primary Email: john@acmecorp.com
CC Email 1: accounting@acmecorp.com
CC Email 2: sarah@acmecorp.com
```

All three receive every invoice sent to ACME Corp.

## Client Enrichment

AI-powered client enrichment automatically finds and fills in company information.

### What is Client Enrichment?

When enabled, Every AI's AI automatically:
- Looks up company details
- Finds company logo
- Fills in address information
- Adds company website
- Enriches other business data

**To Enable Enrichment:**

1. When creating or editing a client, check **Enable Client Enrichment**
2. Provide at least a company name
3. AI searches for company information
4. Found data is automatically populated
5. Review and approve or adjust as needed

**What Gets Enriched:**
- Company name (standardized)
- Logo (official company logo)
- Website URL
- Business address
- Company description
- Industry information

<Tip>
  Client enrichment works best for established businesses with a web presence. It may not find data for individuals or very small businesses.
</Tip>

### When to Use Enrichment

**Use enrichment for:**
- B2B clients (business-to-business)
- Established companies
- Clients with websites
- Corporate customers

**Skip enrichment for:**
- Individual/personal clients
- Clients you already have complete info for
- Privacy-sensitive situations

## Google Contacts Integration

Import existing contacts directly from Google Contacts.

### Setting Up Google Contacts Sync

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Click **Connect Google Account**
3. Grant permissions for Google Contacts access
4. Authorization complete

### Importing Contacts

1. Go to **Clients** page
2. Click **Import from Google Contacts**
3. See list of available contacts

**What Gets Imported:**

- Phone numbers
- Company/organization
- Addresses
- Notes

**Sync Behavior:**
- Import is one-time (not continuous sync)
- Changes in Google Contacts don't automatically update Every AI
- Re-import to refresh if needed

## Managing Clients

### Editing Client Information

1. Open client detail page
2. Click **Edit Client**
3. Update any field
4. Click **Save Changes**

**Editable Fields:**
- All contact information
- CC email addresses
- Company details
- Notes and tags
- Archive status

<Note>
  Changes to client information don't affect existing invoices. Only new invoices use updated information.
</Note>

### Archiving Clients

Archive inactive clients instead of deleting them:

**To Archive:**
1. Open client detail page
2. Click **Archive Client**
3. Confirm archiving

**What Happens:**
- Client hidden from main list
- Past invoices and data preserved
- Can be restored anytime
- Client no longer appears in dropdown menus

**Why Archive Instead of Delete:**
- Preserves historical data
- Maintains invoice integrity
- Enables reporting on past work
- Can reactivate if client returns

**To Restore Archived Client:**
1. Filter to show archived clients
2. Open archived client
3. Click **Restore Client**
4. Client returns to active status

### Deleting Clients

<Warning>
  **Use with caution:** Deleting a client permanently removes them and may affect related invoices.
</Warning>

**Delete Requirements:**
- Client must have no issued invoices
- Client must have no outstanding payments
- All invoices must be draft or deleted first

**To Delete:**
1. Ensure client has no issued invoices
2. Open client detail page
3. Click **Delete Client**
4. Confirm permanent deletion

<Tip>
  In most cases, **archiving is better than deleting**. It preserves your data and history.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Client Enrichment Not Finding Data

**Possible reasons:**

- No web presence
- Name spelled incorrectly
- Company not in public database

**Solutions:**
- Try different company name variations
- Manually enter information
- Add company website to help AI search
- Skip enrichment and enter manually

### Can't Delete Client

**Reason:** Client has issued invoices

**Solution:**
- Archive the client instead, or
- Void all client invoices first, or
- Keep the client for historical records

### Duplicate Clients After Import

**Prevention:**
- Every AI checks for duplicates by email
- Don't import same contact twice
- Review import preview before confirming

**Solution:**
- Archive or delete duplicate
- Merge data manually if needed
- Use unique emails for each client

### CC Emails Not Receiving Invoices

**Check:**
- CC email addresses saved correctly
- No typos in email addresses
- Check client's spam folders
- Verify invoice was "sent" not just "drafted"
