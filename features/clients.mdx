## Overview

Clients are the customers you invoice for services. Manage contact information, track payment history, and organize customer relationships.

<Note>
  **Required for Invoices:** Create at least one client before sending invoices.
</Note>

**Key capabilities:**
- Store contact info (email, phone, address)
- Add CC email recipients for invoice copies
- AI-powered company enrichment
- Import from Google Contacts
- Track payment history and invoices
- View complete activity timeline

## Creating Clients

Go to **Clients** → **Add Client** → Fill name and email → **Save**

**Required:** Client name
**Recommended:** Email address (needed for invoicing)
**Optional:** Phone, website, address

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create new clients instantly with natural language:
  - "Create a client named ACME Corp with email contact@acme.com"
  - "Add a new client for TechStart Inc, email is john@techstart.com, phone is 555-0123"
  - "Create a client called Sarah Johnson with email sarah@consulting.com and address 123 Main St, New York, NY 10001"
</Tip>

### CC Email Addresses

Add up to 2 additional recipients per client. All CC recipients receive invoice copies automatically.

**Common uses:** Accounting departments, project managers, decision-makers

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Set up CC emails for your clients:
  - "Add accounting@acmecorp.com as a CC email for ACME Corp"
  - "Update the client XYZ Company to CC sarah@xyz.com and john@xyz.com on invoices"
  - "Add billing@techstart.com as an additional recipient for TechStart Inc"
</Tip>

## Client Enrichment

AI-powered enrichment automatically finds and fills company information.

**How it works:** Check **Enable Client Enrichment** when creating/editing → Every Agent searches for company data → Review and approve

**What gets enriched:** Company name, logo, website, address, industry info

<Tip>
  Works best for established businesses with web presence. May not find data for small businesses or individuals.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Enable enrichment automatically when creating clients:
  - "Create and enrich a client for Microsoft Corporation"
  - "Add XYZ Consulting as a client and find their company information"
  - "Enrich the existing client Tesla Inc with updated company details"
</Tip>

## Google Contacts Integration

Import existing contacts from Google Contacts.

**Setup:** Settings → Integrations → Connect Google Account

**Import:** Clients → Import from Google Contacts → Select contacts → Import Selected

**What imports:** Name, email, phone, company, address, notes

<Note>
  Import is one-time, not continuous sync. Re-import to refresh. Duplicates prevented by email check.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Import contacts seamlessly:
  - "Import all my Google Contacts as clients"
  - "Sync my contacts from Google and create clients for them"
  - "Import contacts from Google that have email addresses"
</Tip>

### Search & Filtering

**Filter by:** Active/archived, outstanding/overdue invoices, revenue
**Sort by:** Alphabetical, recent, revenue, invoice count

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Find and filter clients easily:
  - "Show me all clients with overdue invoices"
  - "Find clients with outstanding balances"
  - "List all archived clients"
  - "Show me clients I added this month"
  - "Find the client ACME Corp"
</Tip>

## Managing Clients

### Editing Client Information

Open client → **Edit Client** → Update fields → **Save Changes**

<Note>
  Changes don't affect existing invoices, only new ones.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Update client details quickly:
  - "Update ACME Corp's email to newemail@acme.com"
  - "Change the phone number for TechStart Inc to 555-9999"
  - "Update the address for client XYZ Company to 456 Oak Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102"
  - "Add website www.newsite.com to the client Beta Solutions"
</Tip>

### Archiving Clients

Archive inactive clients to hide them while preserving data.

**To archive:** Open client → **Archive Client** → Confirm

**Benefits:** Preserves history, maintains invoice integrity, can restore anytime

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Archive inactive clients:
  - "Archive the client ABC Inc"
  - "Mark TechStart Inc as archived"
  - "Archive all clients with no invoices in the last 12 months"
  - "Hide the client Old Company from my active list"
</Tip>

**To restore:** Filter archived → Open client → **Restore Client**

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Restore previously archived clients:
  - "Restore the archived client ABC Inc"
  - "Unarchive TechStart Inc"
  - "Reactivate the client Old Company"
</Tip>

### Deleting Clients

<Warning>
  Deleting permanently removes client. Only possible if no issued invoices exist.
</Warning>

**Requirements:** No issued invoices or outstanding payments

**Recommendation:** Archive instead to preserve history

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Delete clients (use with caution):
  - "Delete the draft client Test Company"
  - "Remove the client XYZ Corp that has no invoices"
  - "Permanently delete the client Sample Inc"
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Add complete info** for professional invoices • **Use enrichment** to save time • **Set CC emails** for team visibility • **Archive** instead of deleting
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

**Enrichment not finding data:** Try name variations, add website, or enter manually
**Can't delete client:** Archive instead (client has issued invoices)
**Duplicate imports:** System checks by email, merge manually if needed
**CC emails not working:** Verify addresses, check spam, ensure invoice was sent
