- AI-powered company and contact enrichment
- Pull contacts from Google Workspace (inline suggestions + Scan Contacts workflow)
- Sync contacts with Google Contacts for easy lookup
- Track payment history and invoices
- View complete activity timeline
- Manage social links (LinkedIn, website, etc.)

## Creating Clients

Go to **Clients** → **Add Client** → Fill name and email → **Save**

**Required:** Client name
**Recommended:** Email address (needed for invoicing)
**Optional:** Phone, website, address

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create new clients instantly with natural language:
  - "Create a client named ACME Corp with email contact@acme.com"
  - "Add a new client for TechStart Inc, email is john@techstart.com, phone is 555-0123"
  - "Create a client called Sarah Johnson with email sarah@consulting.com and address 123 Main St, New York, NY 10001"
</Tip>

### Client Contacts

Every supports multiple contacts per client with role-based email routing - send invoices to billing while proposals go to the CEO.

**Contact Fields:**
- Name, email, phone, job title
- Invoice role (Primary recipient, CC, or excluded)
- Proposal role (Primary recipient, CC, or excluded)
- Notes for context

**How Roles Work:**
- **Primary (TO):** One contact receives the main email - required for each document type
- **CC:** Additional contacts copied on emails - can have multiple
- **Excluded (None):** Contact stored but not included in emails

**Example Setup:**
```
ACME Corp Contacts:
├── John Smith (CEO)
│   └── Invoices: CC | Proposals: Primary
├── Sarah Johnson (CFO)
│   └── Invoices: Primary | Proposals: CC
└── Accounts Team
    └── Invoices: CC | Proposals: None
```

**To Add Contacts:**
1. Open client → Edit → Add Contact
2. Enter contact details
3. Set invoice and proposal roles
4. First contact defaults to Primary for both

<Note>
  You must have exactly one Primary contact per document type. Cannot have CC recipients without a Primary.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage client contacts:
  - "Add a contact John Smith to ACME Corp with email john@acme.com"
  - "Set Sarah as the primary invoice recipient for ACME Corp"
  - "Add accounts@acme.com as a CC on invoices for ACME Corp"
  - "Show me all contacts for ACME Corp"
</Tip>

### Social & Web Links

Add LinkedIn profiles, websites, and other social links to clients and contacts for quick reference.

**Supported Links:** Website, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, GitHub

**To Add:** Open client → Links section → Add Link → Select type → Enter URL

<Tip>
  Social links are often populated automatically during enrichment.
</Tip>

## Client Enrichment

AI-powered enrichment automatically finds and fills company and contact information from multiple sources.

**How it works:** Open a client record → Click **Enrich Client** button → Choose enrichment mode → Every Agent queries Gmail, Calendar, web data, and Google Contacts to populate details.

**What gets enriched:**
- **Company Data:** Name, logo, website, address, industry, description
- **Contacts:** Discovers additional contacts at the company domain from Gmail headers and Google Contacts
- **Social Links:** LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social profiles

**Enrichment Modes:**
- **Fill Empty (default):** Only adds data to blank fields, preserves your existing entries
- **Overwrite:** Updates all fields with enriched data, replacing existing values

**Contact Discovery:**
When enriching a business client, Every Agent can discover additional contacts:
1. Scans your Gmail for emails from the company domain (last 180 days)
2. Searches your Google Contacts for matching domain
3. Creates new contacts with appropriate roles

<Tip>
  Works best for established businesses with web presence. May not find data for small businesses or individuals.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Trigger enrichment from chat:
  - "Create and enrich a client for Microsoft Corporation"
  - "Add XYZ Consulting as a client and pull their latest company information"
  - "Enrich the existing client Tesla Inc with updated company details"
  - "Find additional contacts for ACME Corp from my emails"
</Tip>

## Google Contacts Integration

Bring Google Workspace context directly into client creation and keep contacts synced.

**Setup:** Settings → Integrations → Connect Google Account (grant Contacts plus Gmail/Calendar for best results)

### Adding Contacts from Google

**Three ways to use it:**
- **Email Autocomplete:** When typing in the Email field on a contact form, suggestions from your Google Contacts appear. Select one to auto-fill name, phone, and other details.
- **Scan Contacts:** On the **Home** dashboard → **Import Data** → **Scan Contacts**. Analyzes recent Gmail, Calendar, and Contacts activity to suggest contacts that look like business clients.
- **During Enrichment:** When enriching a client, Every Agent searches your Google Contacts for additional contacts at the same company domain.

**What gets imported:** Name, email, phone, organization, notes

### Google Contacts Sync

Every tracks which of your contacts already exist in your team's Google Contacts.

**How it works:**
- When a contact is created with an email, Every checks if that email exists in any team member's Google Contacts
- A sync indicator shows on contacts that match
- Daily background sync keeps the status current

**Benefits:**
- See at a glance which contacts are already in your Google ecosystem
- Avoid duplicating contacts you already have
- Know when colleagues have worked with a contact before

<Note>
  Scans are on-demand, not continuous sync. Re-run **Scan Contacts** or ask Every Agent again when you want a fresh batch of suggestions. Duplicate clients are prevented via email matching.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Run the scan from chat:
  - "Scan my Google contacts and add likely clients"
  - "Review Google contacts tagged as clients and add them to Every"
  - "Show me Google contacts we haven't added yet"
</Tip>

## Client Features

### Client History

View complete activity timeline per client:
- Invoice history and status
- Proposal history and approvals
- Payment records
- Email tracking (sends, opens, clicks)

### Client Pipeline (CRM View)

Every includes a visual pipeline for tracking client relationships, deals, and opportunities - like a lightweight CRM built directly into your invoicing platform.

**To access:** Clients page → Toggle from Table view to **Pipeline view**

#### Pipeline Views

**Table View (Default):**
- Spreadsheet-style list of all clients
- Sort and filter by name, revenue, status
- Quick search
- Bulk actions

**Pipeline View:**
- Visual kanban board with client cards
- Drag clients between status columns
- See deal values and proposal status at a glance
- Quick actions on each card

#### Status Columns

Organize clients by where they are in your sales/relationship funnel:

**Default statuses:**
- **Lead:** Potential client, early conversation
- **Qualified:** Interested, budget confirmed
- **Proposal Sent:** Waiting for proposal approval
- **Active Client:** Work in progress
- **Closed - Won:** Successful engagement
- **Closed - Lost:** Opportunity didn't convert

**Customize statuses:** Create your own pipeline stages in **Clients → Pipeline Settings**

#### Using the Pipeline

**Drag & Drop:**
1. Grab a client card
2. Drag to new status column
3. Drop to update status
4. Status change saves automatically
5. Full history tracked

**Client Cards Show:**
- Client name and logo (if enriched)
- Current status
- Total revenue (all invoices)
- Outstanding balance
- Proposal count and status
- HubSpot badge (if synced from HubSpot)
- Last activity date

**Quick Actions (Click card):**
- Create invoice
- Create proposal
- Log time entry
- Add expense
- Set up automation
- View full client details

#### Pipeline Workflows

**Lead Qualification:**
1. Create client as "Lead"
2. Initial conversation → Move to "Qualified"
3. Send proposal → Move to "Proposal Sent"
4. Proposal approved → Move to "Active Client"
5. Complete work → Move to "Closed - Won"

**Ongoing Client Management:**
- Active clients stay in "Active Client" column
- Filter by status to focus on specific segments
- Track revenue per status
- Identify stuck deals (long time in one status)

**Sales Pipeline Tracking:**
```
Lead (10 clients, $50K potential)
  ↓ (qualify)
Qualified (5 clients, $30K potential)
  ↓ (send proposal)
Proposal Sent (3 clients, $20K potential)
  ↓ (approved)
Active Client (15 clients, $100K in progress)
```

#### Integration with HubSpot

If you sync clients from HubSpot:
- HubSpot deal badge appears on client cards
- Shows HubSpot deal stage
- Indicates CRM is source of truth
- Updates flow from HubSpot to Every

**Use case:** Track deals in HubSpot, invoice and manage payments in Every

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage pipeline:
  - "Move ACME Corp to Active Client status"
  - "Show me all clients in the Proposal Sent stage"
  - "Update the status for TechStart Inc to Qualified"
  - "List all leads from this month"
</Tip>

#### Pipeline Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Keep status current** - Update as relationships progress so pipeline reflects reality
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review weekly** - Check pipeline for stuck deals and follow-up opportunities
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Track conversion rates** - Monitor how many leads become active clients
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use for prioritization** - Focus on high-value proposals and qualified leads
</Tip>

### Search & Filtering

**Search by:** Name, email, company, phone
**Filter by:** Active/archived, outstanding/overdue invoices, revenue
**Sort by:** Alphabetical, recent, revenue, invoice count

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Find and filter clients easily:
  - "Show me all clients with overdue invoices"
  - "Find clients with outstanding balances"
  - "List all archived clients"
  - "Show me clients I added this month"
  - "Find the client ACME Corp"
</Tip>

## Managing Clients

### Editing Client Information

Open client → **Edit Client** → Update fields → **Save Changes**

<Note>
  Changes don't affect existing invoices, only new ones.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Update client details quickly:
  - "Update ACME Corp's email to newemail@acme.com"
  - "Change the phone number for TechStart Inc to 555-9999"
  - "Update the address for client XYZ Company to 456 Oak Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102"
  - "Add website www.newsite.com to the client Beta Solutions"
</Tip>

### Archiving Clients

Archive inactive clients to hide them while preserving data.

**To archive:** Open client → **Archive Client** → Confirm

**Benefits:** Preserves history, maintains invoice integrity, can restore anytime

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Archive inactive clients:
  - "Archive the client ABC Inc"
  - "Mark TechStart Inc as archived"
  - "Archive all clients with no invoices in the last 12 months"
  - "Hide the client Old Company from my active list"
</Tip>

**To restore:** Filter archived → Open client → **Restore Client**

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Restore previously archived clients:
  - "Restore the archived client ABC Inc"
  - "Unarchive TechStart Inc"
  - "Reactivate the client Old Company"
</Tip>

### Deleting Clients

<Warning>
  Deleting permanently removes client. Only possible if no issued invoices exist.
</Warning>

**Requirements:** No issued invoices or outstanding payments

**Recommendation:** Archive instead to preserve history

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Delete clients (use with caution):
  - "Delete the draft client Test Company"
  - "Remove the client XYZ Corp that has no invoices"
  - "Permanently delete the client Sample Inc"
</Tip>

## Client Dependencies

Understanding what requires clients:

```
Clients (Required For:)
├── Invoices
│   ├── All invoices must have a client
│   ├── Client info appears on invoice
│   └── Invoice sent to client email
│
├── Proposals
│   ├── Proposals sent to clients
│   └── Approved proposals convert to client invoices
│
├── Time Tracking
│   ├── Track time per client
│   └── Client-specific billing rates
│
├── Expense Billback
│   ├── Bill expenses to clients
│   └── Add expenses to client invoices
│
└── Automations
    ├── Recurring invoices per client
    └── Client-specific automation settings
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Add complete info** for professional invoices • **Use enrichment** to save time • **Set up contact roles** for proper email routing • **Archive** instead of deleting
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

**Enrichment not finding data:** Try name variations, add website, or enter manually
**Can't delete client:** Archive instead (client has issued invoices)
**Duplicate imports:** System checks by email, merge manually if needed
**Contact emails not receiving:** Verify contact has correct role (Primary or CC), check spam, ensure document was sent
**Can't remove Primary contact:** Set another contact as Primary first, or the system will prevent orphan CC recipients
