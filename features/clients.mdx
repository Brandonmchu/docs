## Overview

Clients are the customers you invoice for services. Manage contact information, track payment history, and organize customer relationships.

<Note>
  **Required for Invoices:** Create at least one client before sending invoices.
</Note>

**Key capabilities:**
- Store contact info (email, phone, address)
- Add CC email recipients for invoice copies
- AI-powered company enrichment
- Pull contacts from Google Workspace (inline suggestions + Scan Contacts workflow)
- Track payment history and invoices
- View complete activity timeline

## Creating Clients

Go to **Clients** → **Add Client** → Fill name and email → **Save**

**Required:** Client name
**Recommended:** Email address (needed for invoicing)
**Optional:** Phone, website, address

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create new clients instantly with natural language:
  - "Create a client named ACME Corp with email contact@acme.com"
  - "Add a new client for TechStart Inc, email is john@techstart.com, phone is 555-0123"
  - "Create a client called Sarah Johnson with email sarah@consulting.com and address 123 Main St, New York, NY 10001"
</Tip>

### CC Email Addresses

Add up to 2 additional recipients per client. All CC recipients receive invoice copies automatically.

**Common uses:** Accounting departments, project managers, decision-makers

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Set up CC emails for your clients:
  - "Add accounting@acmecorp.com as a CC email for ACME Corp"
  - "Update the client XYZ Company to CC sarah@xyz.com and john@xyz.com on invoices"
  - "Add billing@techstart.com as an additional recipient for TechStart Inc"
</Tip>

## Client Enrichment

AI-powered enrichment automatically finds and fills company information.

**How it works:** Open a client record → Click the **Actions** menu (⋯) → **Enrich Client**. Every Agent queries Gmail, Calendar, and public data via `/api/enrich-company`, then updates the client once you approve the toast.

**What gets enriched:** Company name, logo, website, address, industry info

<Tip>
  Works best for established businesses with web presence. May not find data for small businesses or individuals.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Trigger enrichment from chat:
  - "Create and enrich a client for Microsoft Corporation"
  - "Add XYZ Consulting as a client and pull their latest company information"
  - "Enrich the existing client Tesla Inc with updated company details"
</Tip>

## Google Contacts Integration

Bring Google Workspace context directly into client creation.

**Setup:** Settings → Integrations → Connect Google Account (grant Contacts plus Gmail/Calendar for best results)

**Two ways to use it:**
- **Inline suggestions:** When you type in the Email field on the client form, the Google Contacts search component appears and auto-fills the rest of the contact details you select.
- **Scan Contacts workflow:** On the **Home** dashboard, open the **Get Started** card → **Scan Contacts**. Google Contacts Analysis reviews recent Gmail, Calendar, and Contacts activity so you can select which suggested contacts to add as clients.

**What gets imported:** Name, email, phone, organization, notes (plus any extra context surfaced by the analysis)

<Note>
  Scans are on-demand, not continuous sync. Re-run **Scan Contacts** or ask Every Agent again when you want a fresh batch of suggestions. Duplicate clients are prevented via email matching.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Run the scan from chat:
  - "Scan my Google contacts and add likely clients"
  - "Review Google contacts tagged as clients and add them to Every"
  - "Show me Google contacts we haven't added yet"
</Tip>

## Client Features

### Client History

View complete activity timeline per client:
- Invoice history and status
- Proposal history and approvals
- Payment records
- Email tracking (sends, opens, clicks)

### Client Pipeline (CRM View)

Every includes a visual pipeline for tracking client relationships, deals, and opportunities - like a lightweight CRM built directly into your invoicing platform.

**To access:** Clients page → Toggle from Table view to **Pipeline view**

#### Pipeline Views

**Table View (Default):**
- Spreadsheet-style list of all clients
- Sort and filter by name, revenue, status
- Quick search
- Bulk actions

**Pipeline View:**
- Visual kanban board with client cards
- Drag clients between status columns
- See deal values and proposal status at a glance
- Quick actions on each card

#### Status Columns

Organize clients by where they are in your sales/relationship funnel:

**Default statuses:**
- **Lead:** Potential client, early conversation
- **Qualified:** Interested, budget confirmed
- **Proposal Sent:** Waiting for proposal approval
- **Active Client:** Work in progress
- **Closed - Won:** Successful engagement
- **Closed - Lost:** Opportunity didn't convert

**Customize statuses:** Create your own pipeline stages in **Clients → Pipeline Settings**

#### Using the Pipeline

**Drag & Drop:**
1. Grab a client card
2. Drag to new status column
3. Drop to update status
4. Status change saves automatically
5. Full history tracked

**Client Cards Show:**
- Client name and logo (if enriched)
- Current status
- Total revenue (all invoices)
- Outstanding balance
- Proposal count and status
- HubSpot badge (if synced from HubSpot)
- Last activity date

**Quick Actions (Click card):**
- Create invoice
- Create proposal
- Log time entry
- Add expense
- Set up automation
- View full client details

#### Pipeline Workflows

**Lead Qualification:**
1. Create client as "Lead"
2. Initial conversation → Move to "Qualified"
3. Send proposal → Move to "Proposal Sent"
4. Proposal approved → Move to "Active Client"
5. Complete work → Move to "Closed - Won"

**Ongoing Client Management:**
- Active clients stay in "Active Client" column
- Filter by status to focus on specific segments
- Track revenue per status
- Identify stuck deals (long time in one status)

**Sales Pipeline Tracking:**
```
Lead (10 clients, $50K potential)
  ↓ (qualify)
Qualified (5 clients, $30K potential)
  ↓ (send proposal)
Proposal Sent (3 clients, $20K potential)
  ↓ (approved)
Active Client (15 clients, $100K in progress)
```

#### Integration with HubSpot

If you sync clients from HubSpot:
- HubSpot deal badge appears on client cards
- Shows HubSpot deal stage
- Indicates CRM is source of truth
- Updates flow from HubSpot to Every

**Use case:** Track deals in HubSpot, invoice and manage payments in Every

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage pipeline:
  - "Move ACME Corp to Active Client status"
  - "Show me all clients in the Proposal Sent stage"
  - "Update the status for TechStart Inc to Qualified"
  - "List all leads from this month"
</Tip>

#### Pipeline Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Keep status current** - Update as relationships progress so pipeline reflects reality
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review weekly** - Check pipeline for stuck deals and follow-up opportunities
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Track conversion rates** - Monitor how many leads become active clients
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use for prioritization** - Focus on high-value proposals and qualified leads
</Tip>

### Search & Filtering

**Search by:** Name, email, company, phone
**Filter by:** Active/archived, outstanding/overdue invoices, revenue
**Sort by:** Alphabetical, recent, revenue, invoice count

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Find and filter clients easily:
  - "Show me all clients with overdue invoices"
  - "Find clients with outstanding balances"
  - "List all archived clients"
  - "Show me clients I added this month"
  - "Find the client ACME Corp"
</Tip>

## Managing Clients

### Editing Client Information

Open client → **Edit Client** → Update fields → **Save Changes**

<Note>
  Changes don't affect existing invoices, only new ones.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Update client details quickly:
  - "Update ACME Corp's email to newemail@acme.com"
  - "Change the phone number for TechStart Inc to 555-9999"
  - "Update the address for client XYZ Company to 456 Oak Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102"
  - "Add website www.newsite.com to the client Beta Solutions"
</Tip>

### Archiving Clients

Archive inactive clients to hide them while preserving data.

**To archive:** Open client → **Archive Client** → Confirm

**Benefits:** Preserves history, maintains invoice integrity, can restore anytime

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Archive inactive clients:
  - "Archive the client ABC Inc"
  - "Mark TechStart Inc as archived"
  - "Archive all clients with no invoices in the last 12 months"
  - "Hide the client Old Company from my active list"
</Tip>

**To restore:** Filter archived → Open client → **Restore Client**

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Restore previously archived clients:
  - "Restore the archived client ABC Inc"
  - "Unarchive TechStart Inc"
  - "Reactivate the client Old Company"
</Tip>

### Deleting Clients

<Warning>
  Deleting permanently removes client. Only possible if no issued invoices exist.
</Warning>

**Requirements:** No issued invoices or outstanding payments

**Recommendation:** Archive instead to preserve history

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Delete clients (use with caution):
  - "Delete the draft client Test Company"
  - "Remove the client XYZ Corp that has no invoices"
  - "Permanently delete the client Sample Inc"
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Add complete info** for professional invoices • **Use enrichment** to save time • **Set CC emails** for team visibility • **Archive** instead of deleting
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

**Enrichment not finding data:** Try name variations, add website, or enter manually
**Can't delete client:** Archive instead (client has issued invoices)
**Duplicate imports:** System checks by email, merge manually if needed
**CC emails not working:** Verify addresses, check spam, ensure invoice was sent
