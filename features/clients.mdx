## Overview

Clients are the **companies and businesses** you work with and invoice. They represent the organizations in your billing relationships - each client can have multiple [contacts](/features/contacts) (people) linked to them.

**Key capabilities:**
- Track client companies with full business details
- AI-powered company enrichment from web, Gmail, and Google Contacts
- Visual CRM pipeline for sales tracking
- Complete billing history (invoices, proposals, payments)
- Link multiple [contacts](/features/contacts) with role-based email routing

## Creating Clients

Go to [**Clients**](https://every.ai/clients) → **Add Client** → Fill name and details → **Save**

**Required:** Client name
**Recommended:** At least one [contact](/features/contacts) with email (needed for invoicing)
**Optional:** Phone, website, address, internal notes

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create new clients instantly:
  - "Create a client named ACME Corp with contact email contact@acme.com"
  - "Add a new client for TechStart Inc, phone 555-0123, website techstart.io"
  - "Create a client called Global Consulting with address 123 Main St, New York, NY 10001"
</Tip>

### Adding Contacts to Clients

Every client needs at least one [contact](/features/contacts) to receive invoices and proposals. Contacts are people - they exist independently and can be linked to multiple clients.

**To add contacts:**
1. Open client → **Edit** → **Add Contact**
2. Search for an existing contact or create a new one
3. Set invoice and proposal roles (Primary, CC, or None)
4. First contact defaults to Primary for both

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage client contacts:
  - "Add John Smith as the primary invoice contact for ACME Corp"
  - "Set Sarah as CC on proposals for ACME Corp"
  - "Show me all contacts for ACME Corp"
</Tip>

<Note>
  For full details on contacts, importing, roles, and linking, see the [Contacts](/features/contacts) documentation.
</Note>

## Client Enrichment

AI-powered enrichment automatically finds and fills company and contact information from multiple sources.

**How it works:** Open a client record → Click **Enrich Client** → Choose enrichment mode → Every Agent queries Gmail, Calendar, web data, and Google Contacts to populate details.

**What gets enriched:**
- **Company Data:** Name, logo, website, address, industry, description
- **Contacts:** Discovers additional contacts at the company domain from Gmail headers and Google Contacts
- **Social Links:** LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social profiles

**Enrichment Modes:**
- **Fill Empty (default):** Only adds data to blank fields, preserves your existing entries
- **Overwrite:** Updates all fields with enriched data, replacing existing values

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Trigger enrichment from chat:
  - "Create and enrich a client for Microsoft Corporation"
  - "Enrich the existing client Tesla Inc with updated company details"
  - "Find additional contacts for ACME Corp from my emails"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Works best for established businesses with web presence. May not find data for small businesses or individuals.
</Tip>

## Client Pipeline (CRM View)

Every includes a visual pipeline for tracking client relationships - like a lightweight CRM built into your invoicing platform.

**To access:** [**Clients**](https://every.ai/clients) page → Toggle from Table view to **Pipeline view**

### Pipeline Views

**Table View (Default):**
- Spreadsheet-style list of all clients
- Sort and filter by name, revenue, status
- Quick search and bulk actions

**Pipeline View:**
- Visual kanban board with client cards
- Drag clients between status columns
- See deal values and proposal status at a glance

### Status Columns

Organize clients by where they are in your sales/relationship funnel:

**Default statuses:**
- **Lead** - Potential client, early conversation
- **Qualified** - Interested, budget confirmed
- **Proposal Sent** - Waiting for proposal approval
- **Active Client** - Work in progress
- **Closed - Won** - Successful engagement
- **Closed - Lost** - Opportunity didn't convert

**Customize statuses:** Create your own pipeline stages in **Clients → Pipeline Settings**

### Using the Pipeline

**Drag & Drop:**
1. Grab a client card
2. Drag to new status column
3. Status change saves automatically

**Client Cards Show:**
- Client name and logo (if enriched)
- Current status
- Total revenue (all invoices)
- Outstanding balance
- Proposal count and status
- Last activity date

**Quick Actions (Click card):**
- Create invoice
- Create proposal
- Log time entry
- Add expense
- Set up automation
- View full client details

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage pipeline:
  - "Move ACME Corp to Active Client status"
  - "Show me all clients in the Proposal Sent stage"
  - "Update the status for TechStart Inc to Qualified"
  - "List all leads from this month"
</Tip>

### Pipeline Workflows

**Lead Qualification:**
1. Create client as "Lead"
2. Initial conversation → Move to "Qualified"
3. Send proposal → Move to "Proposal Sent"
4. Proposal approved → Move to "Active Client"
5. Complete work → Move to "Closed - Won"

**Sales Pipeline Tracking:**
```
Lead (10 clients, $50K potential)
  ↓ (qualify)
Qualified (5 clients, $30K potential)
  ↓ (send proposal)
Proposal Sent (3 clients, $20K potential)
  ↓ (approved)
Active Client (15 clients, $100K in progress)
```

### Pipeline Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Keep status current** - Update as relationships progress so pipeline reflects reality
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review weekly** - Check pipeline for stuck deals and follow-up opportunities
</Tip>

## Client History

View complete activity timeline per client:
- Invoice history and status
- Proposal history and approvals
- Payment records
- Email tracking (sends, opens, clicks)
- Expense and time tracking records

## Search & Filtering

**Search by:** Name, email, company, phone
**Filter by:** Active/archived, pipeline status, outstanding/overdue invoices, revenue
**Sort by:** Alphabetical, recent, revenue, invoice count

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Find and filter clients:
  - "Show me all clients with overdue invoices"
  - "Find clients with outstanding balances"
  - "List all archived clients"
  - "Find the client ACME Corp"
</Tip>

## Managing Clients

### Editing

Open client → [**Edit Client**](https://every.ai/clients) → Update fields → **Save Changes**

<Note>
  Changes don't affect existing invoices, only new ones.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Update client details:
  - "Update ACME Corp's phone to 555-9999"
  - "Change the address for XYZ Company to 456 Oak Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102"
  - "Add website www.newsite.com to the client Beta Solutions"
</Tip>

### Archiving

Archive inactive clients to hide them while preserving all data and history.

**To archive:** Open client → **Archive Client** → Confirm
**To restore:** Filter archived → Open client → **Restore Client**

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Archive or restore:
  - "Archive the client ABC Inc"
  - "Restore the archived client Old Company"
  - "Archive all clients with no invoices in the last 12 months"
</Tip>

### Deleting

<Warning>
  Deleting permanently removes client. Only possible if no issued invoices exist. Archive instead to preserve history.
</Warning>

## Client Dependencies

Understanding what requires clients:

```

│   ├── All invoices must have a client
│   ├── Client info appears on invoice
│   └── Invoice sent to client contacts
│
├── Proposals
│   ├── Proposals sent to client contacts
│   └── Approved proposals convert to invoices
│
├── Contacts (linked)
│   ├── Contacts linked with invoice/proposal roles
│   └── Role-based email routing per client
│
├── Time Tracking
│   ├── Track time per client

│   ├── Bill expenses to clients
│   └── Add expenses to client invoices
│
└── Automations
    ├── Recurring invoices per client
    └── Client-specific automation settings
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Add complete info** for professional invoices - name, address, and at least one contact with email
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use enrichment** to save time filling in company details
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Link contacts with roles** for proper invoice and proposal email routing
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Archive** instead of deleting to preserve billing history
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

**Enrichment not finding data:** Try name variations, add website URL, or enter details manually. Works best for established businesses with web presence.

**Can't delete client:** Archive instead - the client has issued invoices that preserve billing history.

**Invoices not sending to right people:** Check contact roles on the client - ensure one contact has Primary (TO) for invoices. See [Contacts](/features/contacts) for details.

**Duplicate clients:** Search before creating. If duplicates exist, archive one and move contacts/invoices to the other.
