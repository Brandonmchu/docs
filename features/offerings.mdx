## Overview

Offerings are reusable service and product templates that speed up invoicing with standardized pricing and descriptions.

**Key benefits:**
- Add to invoices in one click
- Ensure consistent pricing
- Pre-configured tax rates
- Track rate history
- Professional descriptions

## Types of Offerings

**Services:** Work you perform (consulting, design, development, legal)
- Priced hourly, per project, per session, or day rate

**Products:** Physical or digital items (licenses, downloads, materials)
- Priced per unit, subscription, or one-time purchase

## Creating Offerings

<Note>
  **Required to Create an Offering:**
  - **Name** (appears on invoices)
  - **Type** (Service or Product)
  - **Rate** (hourly, per unit, flat fee, etc.)

  Offerings are optional templates that speed up invoicing. You can always create invoices manually without offerings.
</Note>

Go to **Offerings** → **Add Offering** → Fill details → **Save**

**Required:** Name, type (service/product), rate
**Optional:** Description, tax rate, category, unit, default quantity

<Tip>
  Names and descriptions appear on client invoices - keep them professional!
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create offerings quickly with natural language:
  - "Create a consulting service offering at $150/hour"
  - "Add a service called Website Development at $175 per hour with 13% tax"
  - "Create a product offering for Brand Identity Package priced at $5,000"
  - "Add an hourly consulting service at $200/hour in the Consulting category"
</Tip>

**Example offerings:**
- Website Development: Service, $150/hour, 13% tax
- Brand Identity Package: Product, $2,500 flat, 13% tax

## Using Offerings in Invoices

When creating an invoice: **Add Line Item** → **Select Offering** → Details auto-fill → Adjust quantity if needed

You can override rate, quantity, description, or tax for specific invoices without affecting the offering template.

<Note>
  Invoice changes don't affect the offering template.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Add offerings to invoices effortlessly:
  - "Add my Website Development offering to the invoice for ACME Corp"
  - "Create an invoice for TechStart Inc with my Consulting offering for 10 hours"
  - "Add the Brand Identity Package offering to the current invoice"
  - "Invoice client XYZ Company for 5 hours of my hourly consulting service"
</Tip>


## Managing Offerings

### Organizing Offerings

**Categories:** Group related offerings (Design, Development, Consulting, Products)

**Search & Filter:** By name, description, category, type, rate

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Organize and find your offerings:
  - "Show me all my service offerings"
  - "List all offerings in the Development category"
  - "Find the offering called Website Development"
  - "Show me all product offerings"
  - "List offerings with rates over $100"
</Tip>

### Editing Offerings

Open offering → **Edit Offering** → Update fields → **Save Changes**

Existing invoices unaffected. Changes apply to new invoices only. Rate history preserved.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Update your offerings easily:
  - "Update my consulting rate to $175/hour"
  - "Change the price of Website Development to $200 per hour"
  - "Update the Brand Identity Package to cost $6,000"
  - "Change the description of my Consulting offering to include strategic planning"
  - "Update the tax rate for Design Services to 15%"
</Tip>

### Rate History

View all past rates and dates in offering details. Track increases, justify pricing, maintain historical accuracy.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Review your rate history:
  - "Show me the rate history for my Consulting offering"
  - "What were my past rates for Website Development?"
  - "Display all rate changes for the Brand Identity Package"
</Tip>

### Archiving Offerings

Archive unused offerings: Open offering → **Archive Offering** → Hidden from active list

Archived offerings don't appear in dropdowns but can be restored. Historical usage preserved.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Archive discontinued offerings:
  - "Archive the offering Old Consulting Service"
  - "Mark Website Design v1 as archived"
  - "Hide the offering Legacy Support Package from my active list"
  - "Archive all offerings I haven't used in 6 months"
</Tip>

**To restore:** Filter archived → Open offering → **Restore Offering**

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Restore archived offerings when needed:
  - "Restore the archived offering Old Consulting Service"
  - "Unarchive Website Design v1"
  - "Reactivate the offering Legacy Support Package"
</Tip>

## Advanced Features

**Default Tax Rates:** Set per-offering tax (e.g., 13% standard, 0% exempt) for automatic application

**Standard Quantities:** Pre-fill default quantities (e.g., 1 package, 10 hours) when adding to invoices

**Detailed Descriptions:** Write comprehensive descriptions explaining what's included to set expectations and reduce questions
