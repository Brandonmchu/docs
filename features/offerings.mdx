description: "Create service and product templates with standard pricing for faster, more consistent invoicing"
---

## Overview

Offerings are reusable templates for the services or products you sell. They standardize descriptions, pricing, and tax settings across all your invoices, making invoice creation faster and more consistent.

<Note>
  **Optional but Highly Recommended:** While not required, offerings dramatically speed up invoice creation and ensure consistent pricing.
</Note>

## What Are Offerings?

Think of offerings as your "service menu" or "product catalog." Instead of typing the same service description and rate every time you invoice, you create it once as an offering and reuse it.

**Benefits:**
- **Faster invoicing**: Add offerings to invoices in one click
- **Consistent pricing**: Same rate every time, no mistakes
- **Professional descriptions**: Standardized, polished service descriptions
- **Automatic tax**: Tax rates pre-configured per offering
- **Rate tracking**: History of how your rates change over time

**Examples:**
- Consulting (hourly)
- Design work (per project)
- Development (hourly)
- Legal services (hourly)
- Coaching sessions (per session)
- Strategic planning (per project)

**Common Pricing:**
- Hourly rate
- Per-project flat rate
- Per-session rate
- Day rate

### Products

Products are physical or digital items with set prices.

**Examples:**
- Software licenses

## Using Offerings in Invoices

### Adding Offerings to Invoices

5. Adjust quantity if needed
6. Line item total calculated automatically

**Manual Adjustments:**
- Override rate for this specific invoice
- Change quantity

</Note>

### Quick Invoicing Workflow

With offerings set up:

1. Create new invoice
2. Select client
3. Add offerings (one click each)
4. Adjust quantities if needed
5. Review total

7. Apply tax
8. Calculate total

Offerings save significant time, especially for recurring services!

## Managing Offerings

### Organizing Offerings

**Categories:**
Create categories to group related offerings:
- Design Services
- Development Services
- Consulting
- Products
- Training
- Support Services

Categories help you find offerings quickly when creating invoices.

**Search & Filter:**
- Search by name or description
- Filter by category
- Filter by type (service/product)
- Sort by name or rate

### Editing Offerings

1. Open offering detail page
2. Click **Edit Offering**
3. Update any field
4. Click **Save Changes**

**Impact on Existing Invoices:**
- Existing invoices are NOT affected
- Changes only apply to new invoices
- Rate history preserved

<Tip>
  When raising rates, edit the offering. All new invoices will use the new rate, but historical invoices remain unchanged.
</Tip>

### Rate History

Every AI tracks your rate changes over time:

**View Rate History:**
1. Open offering detail page
2. See **Rate History** section
3. View all past rates and dates

This helps you:
- Track rate increases over time
- Justify current pricing
- Analyze revenue changes
- Maintain historical accuracy

### Archiving Offerings

Archive offerings you no longer use:

1. Open offering detail page
2. Click **Archive Offering**
3. Offering hidden from active list

**Archived offerings:**
- Don't appear in invoice offering dropdown
- Can be restored anytime
- Historical usage preserved
- Still visible on old invoices

**To Restore:**
1. Filter to show archived offerings
2. Open archived offering
3. Click **Restore Offering**

## Advanced Features

### Default Tax Rates

Set tax rates per offering for automatic application:

**Use Cases:**
- Some products/services taxable, others not
- Different tax rates for different offerings
- Exempt services (0% tax)

**Example:**
```
Consulting Services: 13% tax (standard)
Digital Products: 13% tax (standard)
Educational Services: 0% tax (exempt)
```

When you add the offering to an invoice, tax is automatically applied.

### Standard Quantities

Set default quantities for offerings:

**Example Use Cases:**
- Website Design Package: Default 1 package
- Hourly Consulting: Default 10 hours
- Monthly Retainer: Default 1 month

When added to invoice, the default quantity is pre-filled. Adjust as needed.

### Detailed Descriptions

Write comprehensive descriptions that:
- Explain exactly what's included
- Set client expectations
- Maintain professional tone
- Provide value proposition

**Good Description:**
```
"Complete brand strategy consultation including competitive analysis,
target audience research, brand positioning, and strategic roadmap.
Includes 3 rounds of revisions and final presentation deck."
```

**Poor Description:**
```
"Brand consulting"
```

Detailed descriptions make invoices more professional and reduce client questions.

## Troubleshooting

### Offering Not Appearing in Invoice

**Check:**
- Offering is not archived
- Search/filter settings in invoice form
- Offering was saved successfully
- Refresh invoice page

### Wrong Tax Rate Applied

**Solutions:**
- Edit offering and update tax rate
- Override tax on individual invoice line items
- Check organization default tax settings

### Can't Delete Offering

**Reason:** Offering used in existing invoices

**Solution:**
- Archive offering instead
- Keeps historical invoices intact
- Removes from active offering list

### Rate Changed but Old Invoices Show New Rate

**Not possible:** Historical invoices are not affected by rate changes. If seeing new rates on old invoices, something else changed.

**Check:**

- Manual edits made to invoice after rate change
