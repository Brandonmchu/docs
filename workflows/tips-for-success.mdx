## Foundation First

### Complete Organization Setup

**Why It Matters:**
Every feature depends on proper organization configuration. Spending 30 minutes on setup saves hours later.

**Essential Setup Checklist:**
- ✅ Business name, address, email, phone
- ✅ Logo uploaded
- ✅ Brand color set
- ✅ Default currency selected
- ✅ Default due days configured (Net 30 recommended)
- ✅ Sales tax rate set
- ✅ Invoice template chosen
- ✅ Default invoice note added

<Tip>
  Think of organization setup as your invoice template. Get it right once, benefit forever!
</Tip>

### Connect Stripe Early

**The Data Says:**
Clients with online payment options pay 5-10x faster than those without.

**Why:**
- No waiting for checks
- No bank transfer delays
- Instant payment = instant confirmation
- Reduces "forgot to pay" excuses
- Professional payment experience

**Setup Time:** 10 minutes
**Benefit:** Dramatically faster payment

<Tip>
  Even if most clients pay by check, give them the option. You'll be surprised how many use it!
</Tip>

## Client Management

### Use Client Enrichment

**For Business Clients:**
Enable client enrichment to automatically fill in:
- Company logo
- Business address
- Website
- Industry information
- Company description

**Saves Time:** 2-3 minutes per client
**Looks Professional:** Complete, accurate client profiles
**Impresses Clients:** Shows attention to detail

### Add CC Email Addresses

**Keep Teams Informed:**
Add CC emails for:
- Client's accounting department
- Project managers
- Stakeholders
- Internal team members

**Benefits:**
- Everyone stays in loop
- Reduces "I didn't get the invoice" excuses
- Faster approval process
- Better communication

<Tip>
  Ask clients for "who else should receive invoices" during onboarding. Add CC emails immediately!
</Tip>

### Import Google Contacts

**Starting with Every AI?**
Don't manually enter 50 clients. Import them!

**Process:**
1. Connect Google Workspace
2. Import contacts
3. Review and clean up
4. Start invoicing

**Time Savings:** Hours vs minutes

## Invoicing Excellence

### Create Offerings First

**Before Creating Invoices:**
Set up your service/product offerings with standard rates.

**Why:**
- Invoicing becomes 10x faster
- Consistent pricing (no mistakes)
- Professional descriptions
- Automatic tax application
- Rate history tracking

**Investment:** 30 minutes to set up
**Return:** 5-10 minutes saved per invoice, forever

### Use Detailed Line Items

**Bad Line Item:**
```
Consulting - $5,000
```

**Good Line Item:**
```
Brand Strategy Consultation
Competitive analysis, target audience research,
brand positioning workshop, strategic roadmap
development, and final presentation. Includes
3 rounds of revisions.
```

**Why Detailed is Better:**
- Client knows what they're paying for
- Reduces questions and disputes
- Justifies pricing
- Sets clear expectations
- Professional appearance

<Tip>
  Write line item descriptions as if explaining to someone who wasn't in the meeting. Be specific!
</Tip>

### Enable Online Payments (Always)

**Even if client usually pays by check:**
- Give them the option
- Some situations they'll need it
- Emergency payments
- Lost checks
- Faster for everyone

**Default:** Enable on all invoices

### Track Email Delivery

**Don't Follow Up Blindly:**
Check if client opened email before following up.

**Wait for "Opened":**
- Email sent → Wait
- Email opened → Client has seen it
- No response after 3-5 days → Follow up

**Avoids:**
- Annoying clients who haven't had a chance to review
- Appearing overeager
- Wasting time on premature follow-ups

## Time Tracking Mastery

### Use the Timer Widget

**Manual Entry vs Real-Time Tracking:**
- Manual: "I think I worked 4 hours" (probably 3 or 5)
- Timer: "I worked exactly 3.7 hours" (accurate)

**Accuracy Matters:**
- Underbilling costs revenue
- Overbilling damages trust
- Accurate billing is fair to everyone

**Make it Habit:**
1. Open computer
2. Start timer
3. Work
4. Stop timer
5. Repeat

### Add Descriptions Immediately

**Don't Wait:**
"Website homepage design" typed now > "Something for ACME" typed later

**Why:**
- Memory fades fast
- Future you appreciates clarity
- Client understands invoice better
- Prevents disputes

<Tip>
  Set a rule: Can't stop timer without adding description. Forces good habit!
</Tip>

### Mark Non-Billable Time

**Track Everything, Bill Appropriately:**
- Client work → Billable
- Admin tasks → Non-billable
- Learning → Non-billable
- Internal meetings → Non-billable

**Benefits:**
- Know true time investment
- Calculate real profitability
- Improve efficiency
- Accurate utilization metrics

## Automation & Efficiency

### Test Automations Thoroughly

**Before Activating:**
1. Enable test mode
2. Generate test invoice
3. Review every detail:
   - Amounts correct?
   - Line items right?
   - Tax calculated properly?
   - Formatting good?
4. Disable test mode
5. Activate for real

**One Mistake = Monthly Repetition:**
Test once, benefit forever.

### Start Automations as Drafts

**Initial Setup:**
- Action: "Create as Draft"
- Review first 2-3 months
- Verify everything perfect
- Switch to "Send Immediately"

**Why:**
- Catch any edge cases
- Build trust in system
- Then set and forget

<Tip>
  Automations should make you more confident, not more worried. Test until you trust them!
</Tip>

## Expense Management

### Log Expenses Immediately

**Receipt Management:**
Right after expense → Take photo → Upload to Every AI

**Don't Wait Because:**
- Receipts get lost
- Details forgotten
- Tax deductions missed
- Client billbacks forgotten

**Make It Easy:**
Mobile app (future) or email receipt to yourself

### Always Keep Receipts

**Tax Audit Protection:**
IRS/CRA requires receipts for:
- Expenses over certain thresholds
- Any questioned deductions
- Audit documentation

**Best Practice:**
- Upload receipt for every expense
- No receipt = questionable deduction
- Digital storage = safe forever

<Tip>
  Habit: Pay → Photo → Upload. Three steps, done immediately, saves headaches later!
</Tip>

## Communication & Follow-Up

### Set Clear Payment Terms

**Invoice Notes Should Include:**
- Payment due date (clear and prominent)
- Acceptable payment methods
- Late payment policy
- Contact for questions

**Example:**
```
Payment due within 30 days of invoice date.
Pay online with credit card using the button above,
or send payment to [bank details].

Questions? Contact accounting@yourbusiness.com
```

### Follow Up Strategically

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- Day 0: Invoice sent
- Day 3-5: Check if opened (don't contact yet)
- Day 7: Friendly check-in if no response
- Day 15: Payment reminder if unpaid
- Day 25: Urgent reminder if still unpaid
- Day 31+: Serious collection conversation

**Tone Progression:**
- Day 7: "Just wanted to make sure you received this..."
- Day 15: "Friendly reminder that payment is due..."
- Day 25: "We notice payment is overdue. Please remit immediately..."

### Thank Clients for Payments

**Simple But Powerful:**
"Thank you for your payment! We appreciate your business."

**Takes:** 30 seconds
**Impact:** Strengthens relationship, increases retention

<Tip>
  Use Every Agent: "Thank ACME Corp for their payment" → Agent drafts professional thank you!
</Tip>

## Financial Health

### Monitor Cash Flow Weekly

**Weekly Dashboard Check:**
- Outstanding amount
- Overdue amount
- This month's revenue
- Upcoming due dates

**Catch Issues Early:**
- Overdue pile growing → Time for collections focus
- Outstanding amount high → Cash flow concern
- Many drafts → Need to send invoices

### Review Metrics Monthly

**Key Metrics:**
- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
- Payment conversion rate
- Average invoice amount
- Revenue per client
- Profit margin per service

**Track Trends:**
- DSO increasing → Payment slowing
- Conversion dropping → Payment issues
- Revenue per client declining → Upsell opportunity

### Separate Business and Personal

**Mixing = Tax Headache:**
- Separate bank accounts
- Separate credit cards
- Only log business expenses
- Clean books = easier taxes

<Tip>
  Personal expense accidentally in business account? Mark as owner draw, don't log as business expense!
</Tip>

<Tip>

</Tip>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Skip Organization Setup

❌ "I'll do that later" → Invoices look unprofessional, missing info
✅ Set up completely before first invoice

### Don't Create Invoices Without Offerings

❌ Manual line items every time → Slow, error-prone
✅ Create offerings first → Fast, consistent invoicing

### Don't Wait to Send Invoices

❌ "I'll send them all at month end" → Delays payment, hurts cash flow
✅ Send immediately after work complete → Faster payment

### Don't Ignore Email Tracking

❌ "I sent it, they should pay" → Miss opportunities for follow-up
✅ Monitor opens, follow up strategically → Better collection

### Don't Forget to Record Payments

❌ Payment received but not recorded → Invoice shows unpaid, confusion
✅ Record immediately → Accurate status

### Don't Delete, Archive

❌ Delete old client → Lost history, can't reference
✅ Archive inactive client → History preserved, clean active list

## Pro Tips

<Tip>
  **Batch similar tasks** - Process all invoicing Tuesday mornings. All follow-ups Thursday afternoons. Efficiency through batching.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use templates liberally** - Invoice notes, email responses, proposals. Template = consistency + speed.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review weekly, plan monthly** - Weekly: What needs attention? Monthly: What's the bigger picture?
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Automate the predictable** - Recurring clients, regular reminders, routine reports. Automate and forget.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Document your processes** - "How I do month-end" in a doc. Future you (or employee) will thank present you.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Invest in good habits** - 10 minutes daily on Every AI > 3 hours monthly fixing problems. Prevention beats cure.
</Tip>
