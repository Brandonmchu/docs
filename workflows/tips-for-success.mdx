## Foundation First

### Complete Organization Setup

Spend 30 minutes on setup to save hours later. Every feature depends on proper configuration.

**Essential Checklist:**
- ✅ Business info (name, address, email, phone, logo)
- ✅ Brand color
- ✅ Default currency and payment terms (Net 30 recommended)
- ✅ Sales tax rate and invoice note templates

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Let AI configure your entire organization setup:
  - "Set up my organization: Acme Consulting LLC, 123 Main Street Suite 100, hello@acmeconsulting.com, Net 30 payment terms, 8% sales tax"
  - "Update my organization settings with my logo and set brand color to #0066CC"
  - "What's missing from my organization setup? Help me complete it"
</Tip>

### Connect Stripe Early

Clients with online payment options pay 5-10x faster. Even if most pay by check, give them the option.

**Benefits:** No waiting for checks, instant confirmation, reduces "forgot to pay" excuses, professional experience

**Setup Time:** 10 minutes | **Impact:** Dramatically faster payment

## Client Management

### Use Smart Client Features

**Client Enrichment** - Auto-fill company logo, address, website, and industry info for business clients (click more options menu ⋮ → Enrich Client)
**CC Emails** - Add accounting departments, project managers, and stakeholders to keep everyone informed
**Import Contacts** - Use Google contact suggestions in the client form plus the Scan Contacts card on your Home dashboard to add recent contacts in minutes

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Instantly populate your client list:
  - "Scan my Google contacts and add the clients you find"
  - "Connect my Google Workspace and pull in my top business contacts"
  - "Show me Google contacts we've already imported and which ones are missing email addresses"
</Tip>

## Invoicing Excellence

### Create Offerings First

Set up service/product catalog with standard rates before invoicing.

**Benefits:** 10x faster invoicing, consistent pricing, professional descriptions, automatic tax, rate history

**Investment:** 30 minutes | **Return:** 5-10 minutes saved per invoice forever

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Create your service catalog in seconds:
  - "Create offerings for all my standard services: Strategy Consulting $200/hr, Web Development $150/hr, Project Management $175/hr"
  - "Set up product offerings for my digital products with standard pricing"
  - "Show me all my offerings and which ones generate the most revenue"
</Tip>

### Use Detailed Line Items

**Bad:** "Consulting - $5,000"

**Good:** "Brand Strategy Consultation - Competitive analysis, target audience research, brand positioning workshop, strategic roadmap development, and final presentation. Includes 3 rounds of revisions."

**Why:** Reduces disputes, justifies pricing, sets expectations, looks professional

### Track Invoice Status

Monitor which invoices have been sent and are still unpaid to time your follow-ups effectively.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Smart invoice tracking and follow-up:
  - "Show me all sent invoices that are still unpaid"
  - "Which invoices are overdue by more than 7 days?"
  - "Send payment reminders to all clients with invoices overdue by more than 15 days"
</Tip>

## Time Tracking & Expenses

### Use the Timer Widget

**Real-time tracking beats guesswork.** "I think I worked 4 hours" vs "I worked exactly 3.7 hours"

**Make it Habit:** Open computer → Start timer → Work → Stop timer → Add description

### Add Descriptions Immediately

"Website homepage design" typed now > "Something for ACME" typed later. Memory fades fast.

### Log Expenses Immediately

Right after expense → Take photo → Upload to Every

**Why:** Receipts get lost, details forgotten, tax deductions missed, billbacks forgotten

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Effortless expense management:
  - "Log this receipt" (upload photo) → Agent reads and creates expense entry
  - "Show me all my unbilled expenses for this month, organized by client"
  - "Create an expense report for Q4 2024 categorized by type"
  - "Which expenses over $100 don't have receipts attached?"
</Tip>

## Automation & Efficiency

### Test Automations Thoroughly

**Before activating:**
1. Enable test mode
2. Generate test invoice
3. Review amounts, line items, tax, formatting
4. Disable test mode, then activate

**Start with Drafts:** Set automation to "Create as Draft" initially. Review first 2-3 months, then switch to "Send Immediately."

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Set up and manage automations easily:
  - "Create a monthly automation for Acme Corp - $5000 retainer on the 1st of each month"
  - "Show me all my active automations and when they'll run next"
  - "Pause the automation for Smith Industries until next quarter"
  - "Test run all my automations to make sure they're working correctly"
</Tip>

## Communication Strategy

### Set Clear Payment Terms

**Invoice notes should include:**
- Payment due date (clear and prominent)
- Acceptable payment methods
- Late payment policy
- Contact for questions

### Follow Up Strategically

**Timeline:**
- Day 0: Invoice sent
- Day 7: Friendly check-in if no response
- Day 15: Payment reminder if unpaid
- Day 25: Urgent reminder if overdue
- Day 31+: Serious collection conversation

**Tone Progression:** Friendly → Reminder → Urgent

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Automate strategic follow-ups:
  - "Send friendly reminders to all clients with invoices due in the next 3 days"
  - "Which invoices are overdue by more than 30 days? Draft firm payment reminder emails"
  - "Show me payment patterns - which clients consistently pay late?"
</Tip>

### Thank Clients for Payments

Simple but powerful: "Thank you for your payment! We appreciate your business."

**Impact:** 30 seconds, strengthens relationships, increases retention

## Financial Health

### Monitor Weekly & Review Monthly

**Weekly Dashboard:**
- Outstanding amount
- Overdue amount
- This month's revenue
- Upcoming due dates

**Monthly Metrics:**
- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
- Payment conversion rate
- Revenue per client
- Profit margin per service

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Get instant financial insights:
  - "Show me my cash flow dashboard - total outstanding, overdue amounts, this month's revenue"
  - "What's my Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and how has it trended over the last 6 months?"
  - "Who are my top 10 clients by total revenue? Show me year-over-year comparison"
  - "Calculate my payment conversion rate and average time to payment by client"
</Tip>

## Leverage AI

### Chat with Agent Regularly

Make Every Agent your assistant for:
- "What should I focus on this week?"
- "Which invoices are overdue?"
- "Create an invoice for..."
- "Send reminder to slow-paying clients"

### Customize Business Context

Update organization prompt with your services, target clients, communication style, and pricing philosophy.

**Result:** Agent responses perfectly aligned with your business

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Leverage AI for complete workflow automation:
  - "Review all my clients and suggest which ones might be good candidates for retainer agreements"
  - "Analyze my pricing strategy - am I charging market rates for my services?"
  - "Draft a proposal for Acme Corp for a 3-month consulting engagement, use my standard rates and format"
  - "What should I focus on this week to improve my cash flow?"
</Tip>

### Upload Reference Files

Give Every Agent access to:
- Standard service agreement
- Rate card and pricing
- Brand guidelines
- Proposal templates

**Benefit:** Consistent terms, correct pricing, brand voice maintained

## Growth Strategies

### Analyze Your Best Clients

Identify patterns in revenue, payment speed, profitability, and repeat business. Double down on what works.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Identify and replicate success patterns:
  - "Analyze my client base - who are my most profitable clients and what do they have in common?"
  - "Which clients have the best payment history? Help me find similar prospects"
  - "Compare my top 5 vs bottom 5 clients - what patterns should I look for?"
</Tip>

### Track Service Performance

**Optimize your offerings:**
- Promote high-margin services
- Improve or drop low-margin services
- Price based on value, not just cost

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Optimize your service portfolio:
  - "Rank all my services by profitability - which should I focus on selling more?"
  - "How much time am I spending on each service type? Is it worth the revenue?"
  - "Which offerings have I used most in the last 6 months and what's the trend?"
</Tip>

### Increase Rates Regularly

Annual rate review: Skills improve, experience accumulates, market rates change.

**How:** Update offerings with new rates, grandfather existing clients (optional), new projects at new rates

<Tip>
  Most service businesses should increase rates 5-10% annually to keep pace with inflation and skill growth!
</Tip>
