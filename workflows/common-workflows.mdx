## Overview

Follow these proven patterns for common business workflows. Each workflow includes "Ask Every Agent" examples to automate the process.

## Complete New Business Setup

**Week 1: Foundation**
1. **Organization Setup** - Complete business profile, upload logo, set currency and payment terms, configure tax rate
2. **Payment Processing** - Connect and verify Stripe account
3. **Integrations** - Connect Google Workspace or HubSpot if needed
4. **Add Clients** - Create manually, use Google contact suggestions/Scan Contacts, then run client enrichment
5. **Create Offerings** - Set up all services/products with standard rates

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Streamline your entire business setup:
  - "Set up my business - name is Acme Consulting, address 123 Main St, default payment terms Net 30, currency USD"
  - "Create offerings for my standard services: hourly consulting at $150/hour, monthly retainer at $5000/month, and project management at $200/hour"
  - "Scan my Google contacts and categorize them by business type"
</Tip>

**Week 2: First Invoice**
6. **Create First Invoice** - Select client, add offerings, review appearance, test before sending
7. **Track and Follow Up** - Monitor delivery, note when opened, record payment

<Tip>
  Don't try to do everything at once. Follow this week-by-week plan for smooth onboarding!
</Tip>

## Service Business Workflow

**For consultants, developers, designers, and other service professionals.**

**Week 1-4: Work & Track**
- Track time using timer widget (start/stop for each work session)
- Log expenses immediately with receipts
- Mark billable vs non-billable

**End of Month: Invoicing**
- Review all unbilled time and expenses by client
- Create invoice with unbilled items
- Add project summary highlighting achievements
- Send and track delivery

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- Day 7: Check if opened
- Day 15: Friendly reminder if unpaid
- Day 25: Urgent reminder if overdue
- Record payment when received

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Let AI handle your entire monthly invoicing cycle:
  - "Show me all unbilled time for Acme Corp this month and create their invoice"
  - "Create invoices for all my clients with unbilled time, including their expenses"
  - "Log 3.5 hours for Acme Corp today - worked on website redesign mockups"
  - "What's my total billable time this month? Break it down by client"
</Tip>

## Product Business Workflow

**Per-Order Process:**
1. Receive order and confirm availability
2. Create invoice with products from offerings
3. Apply discounts, shipping, and tax
4. Send immediately with payment link (Net 7 or 15)
5. Fulfill when paid
6. Record completion and request feedback

**For Wholesale:** Use standing offerings, automations for regular orders, volume discounts, and Net 30 terms.

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Speed up your product invoicing:
  - "Create an invoice for Acme Corp: 5x Widget Pro at $200 each, 10x Widget Basic at $100 each, plus shipping"
  - "Show me all pending orders that need invoices this week"
  - "Create a bulk invoice for Smith Industries with their regular monthly order"
</Tip>

## Recurring Client Workflow

**Setup (One-Time):**
1. Define retainer terms (monthly fee, included services, overage rates)
2. Create automation (select client, set monthly schedule, add line items)
3. Test thoroughly in test mode
4. Activate with "Create as Draft" initially

**Ongoing (Monthly):**
- Review generated draft on 1st of month
- Add any overages or adjustments
- Send invoice
- Track hours used vs allocated
- Monitor payments (typically 5-7 days)

**Annual Review:** Evaluate performance, adjust rates, update automation, communicate changes

<Tip>
  Start automations with "Create as Draft" until you trust them, then switch to "Send Immediately" for full automation!
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Manage recurring billing workflows conversationally:
  - "Set up monthly retainer billing for Acme Corp - $5000/month on the 1st, includes 40 hours of consulting"
  - "Show me all my recurring clients and when their next invoices are due"
  - "Create automations for all my retainer clients to bill on the first of each month"
  - "Which recurring clients are approaching their hour limits this month?"
</Tip>

## Proposal to Invoice Workflow

**Discovery & Proposal:**
1. Initial client meeting (understand needs, define scope, discuss budget)
2. Create proposal with detailed scope, deliverables, pricing, and expiration date
3. Send and track opens
4. Negotiate and revise if needed

**Approval & Work:**
5. Receive approval with signature
6. Convert to invoice (all line items copy over)
7. Send for deposit or full payment
8. Complete work and deliver

**Completion:**
9. Send final invoice if using deposit model
10. Collect payment, send thank you, request testimonial

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Streamline your proposal-to-payment workflow:
  - "Create a proposal for Acme Corp - brand strategy consultation, 40 hours at $150/hour, includes research, workshops, and final presentation"
  - "Show me all proposals waiting for client approval"
  - "Convert the approved Acme Corp proposal to an invoice with 50% deposit due upfront"
  - "Send payment reminders to all clients with invoices from approved proposals"
</Tip>

## Expense Billback Workflow

**During Project:**
1. Incur expense (travel, materials, software)
2. Log immediately - take photo, upload receipt, mark billable
3. Categorize for tracking

**Billing Cycle:**
4. Review unbilled expenses by client
5. Add to invoice via "Add from Expenses"
6. Apply markup if policy requires
7. Send invoice (expenses marked as billed)

**Best Practices:** Log immediately, keep receipts, be transparent, communicate large expenses upfront

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Make expense tracking and billback effortless:
  - "Log this expense receipt" (upload image) → Agent extracts amount, date, vendor, category
  - "Show me all unbilled expenses for Acme Corp and add them to their next invoice"
  - "Create an expense report for all my Q4 billable expenses by client"
  - "Which clients have unbilled expenses over $500?"
</Tip>

## Monthly Close Workflow

**Days 25-30: Preparation**
1. Review month activity (invoices sent, payments received, outstanding balance)
2. Follow up on overdue invoices
3. Complete and send all draft invoices
4. Bill all recurring clients

**Day 1-5: New Month Start**
5. Generate monthly reports (revenue, outstanding, expenses, taxes)
6. Update forecasts and set monthly goals
7. Export data for accounting

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Automate your month-end close process:
  - "Show me all overdue invoices and send reminders to those clients"
  - "Generate my revenue report for last month and show top 5 clients"
  - "Which invoices are still in draft status? Send them all now"
  - "Create a cash flow summary: total sent, total paid, total outstanding this month"
  - "Export all my November invoices and expenses for my accountant"
