## Client Issues

### Client Enrichment Not Finding Data

**Solutions:**

**Solutions:**
- Reconnect Google integration and re-run **Scan Contacts**

## Automation Issues

### Automation Not Running

**Check:**

### Agent Made Mistake

**Immediate Action:**
```
"Undo that"
[Wait for undo confirmation]
"Create invoice for ACME Corp (not XYZ), $5,000"
```

**Prevention:**
- Review agent proposals before approving
- Be specific in requests
- Correct immediately if wrong
