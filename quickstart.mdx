## Get Started in Four Steps

This guide will walk you through setting up your Every AI account and sending your first professional invoice. You'll be ready to start billing clients in about 15 minutes.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Organization

Your organization is the foundation of your Every AI account. It stores your business information, branding, and default settings.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="building" title="Create your organization profile">
    1. Sign up at [app.every.ai](https://app.every.ai) and create your account
    2. Create or join an organization (your business)
    3. Navigate to **Settings** → **Organization**
    4. Fill in your business details:
       - Business name (required)
       - Email and phone
       - Business address
       - Website

    <Tip>This information appears on all your invoices, so make sure it's accurate!</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Customize your branding">
    In **Settings** → **Organization**, customize your brand:

    1. **Upload your logo** - Appears on invoices and public pages
    2. **Set brand color** - Used in templates and invoice pages
    3. **Choose invoice template** - Select from professional designs
    4. **Add default notes** - Standard terms that appear on all invoices

    <Note>Your branding is applied automatically to all invoices and proposals.</Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Configure financial defaults">
    Set your default financial settings in **Settings** → **Organization**:

    - **Default currency**: USD or CAD (can be overridden per invoice)
    - **Default due days**: How many days until payment is due (1-365)
    - **Sales tax default**: Your standard tax rate
    - **Invoice numbering**: Automatic sequential numbering

    These defaults save time when creating invoices.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Add Your First Client

Clients are the customers you invoice. Every AI makes it easy to create and manage client relationships.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-plus" title="Create a client">
    1. Navigate to **Clients** in the main menu
    2. Click **Add Client** or the **+** button
    3. Fill in client information:
       - **Name** (required)
       - Email address
       - Phone number
       - Company address
       - Website (optional)
    4. Add **CC email addresses** (up to 2) to send invoice copies to additional recipients
    5. Click **Save**

    <Tip>Enable **Client Enrichment** to let AI automatically find company details, logo, and address information!</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="google" title="Import from Google Contacts (optional)">
    If you use Google Workspace, you can import existing contacts:

    1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
    2. Connect your Google account
    3. Navigate to **Clients**
    4. Click **Import from Google Contacts**
    5. Select contacts to import

    This saves time if you already have clients in Google Contacts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Create Your First Invoice

Now you're ready to create and send your first professional invoice.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file-invoice" title="Build your invoice">
    1. Navigate to **Invoices** in the main menu
    2. Click **Create Invoice** or the **+** button
    3. **Select a client** from your client list
    4. **Add line items** - the services or products you're billing:
       - Click **Add Line Item**
       - Enter description, quantity, and rate
       - Add tax if applicable
       - Repeat for additional items
    5. **Set payment terms**:
       - Issue date (today by default)
       - Due date (uses your default due days)
       - Add reference/PO number if needed
    6. **Add notes** (optional) - Payment instructions or terms
    7. **Attach files** (optional) - Contracts, receipts, or documents

    <Tip>The invoice total is calculated automatically as you add line items!</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="list-check" title="Use offerings for faster invoicing (optional)">
    **Offerings** are templates for your services or products with pre-set pricing.

    To create an offering:
    1. Navigate to **Offerings**
    2. Click **Add Offering**
    3. Enter name, description, standard rate
    4. Save

    Now when creating invoices, you can quickly add offerings instead of typing everything manually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="paper-plane" title="Send your invoice">
    Once your invoice is ready:

    1. Review the invoice preview on the right
    2. Click **Save as Draft** to save without sending, or
    3. Click **Send Invoice** to email it immediately

    When you send an invoice:
    - Client receives a professional email with invoice attached
    - CC recipients (if added) receive a copy
    - You can track when they open the email
    - Client gets a secure link to view and pay the invoice

    <Note>Invoices are saved as **Draft** until you explicitly send them. You can always edit draft invoices before sending.</Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 4: Set Up Payment Processing (Optional but Recommended)

Enable online credit card payments so clients can pay invoices instantly.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="stripe" title="Connect Stripe">
    1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Payments**
    2. Click **Connect Stripe Account**
    3. Follow the Stripe onboarding process:
       - Provide business information
       - Add bank account for payouts
       - Verify your identity
    4. Complete the setup

    Once connected, your invoices will include a **Pay Now** button for credit card payments.

    <Tip>Clients with online payment options pay significantly faster!</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="credit-card" title="How online payments work">
    When Stripe is connected:

    - Each invoice has a secure payment page
    - Clients can pay with credit/debit cards
    - Payments are processed automatically
    - Invoice status updates to **Paid** when payment is received
    - You receive email notifications of payments
    - Funds are deposited to your bank account per Stripe's schedule

    **Processing fees**: Standard Stripe rates apply (typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="hand-holding-dollar" title="Manual payments">
    You can also record payments received outside the platform:

    1. Open an invoice
    2. Click **Record Payment**
    3. Enter:
       - Amount received
       - Payment date
       - Payment method (cash, check, bank transfer, etc.)
       - Optional notes
    4. Save

    The invoice status updates automatically based on payment received.
