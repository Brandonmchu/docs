## Get Started in Four Steps

Set up your Every account and send your first invoice in 15 minutes.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Organization

Your organization stores your business information, branding, and default settings that appear on all invoices.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="building-2" title="Create your organization profile">
    Go to **Settings** → **Organization** and fill in:
    - Business name (required)
    - Email, phone, and address
    - Website (optional)

    <Tip>This information appears on all your invoices, so make sure it's accurate!</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="paintbrush" title="Customize your branding">
    In **Settings** → **Organization**, set up:
    - **Brand color** - Used in templates and invoice pages

    In **Invoices** → **Customize**, set up:
    - **Logo** - Appears on invoices and public pages
    - **Note templates** - Reusable text blocks for invoice notes (payment terms, thank you messages, etc.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="settings" title="Configure financial defaults">
    Set defaults in **Settings** → **Organization**:
    - **Currency**: USD or CAD
    - **Due days**: Payment timeline (e.g., Net 30)
    - **Sales tax**: Your standard tax rate
    - **Invoice numbering**: Automatic sequential
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Update my organization name to ABC Consulting" or "Set my default invoice terms to Net 45"
</Tip>

### Step 2: Add Your First Client and Contacts

**Clients** are the companies you invoice. **Contacts** are the people at those companies who receive your invoices and proposals.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="building-2" title="Create a client (company)">
    Go to [**Clients**](https://every.ai/clients) → **Add Client** and enter:
    - Company name (required)
    - Phone, address, website (optional)

    <Tip>After saving, click the **Enrich** button to let Every Agent pull company details from Gmail, Calendar, and the web. If you've already enriched a client, click the more options menu and choose **Enrich Again**.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="user-round" title="Add contacts (people)">
    Open the client → **Edit** → **Add Contact** to add people:
    - Name and email (needed for sending invoices)
    - Phone, job title (optional)
    - Set invoice and proposal roles (Primary or CC)

    Or go to [**Contacts**](https://every.ai/contacts) to manage contacts independently and link them to clients.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="file-import" title="Import contacts (optional)">
    Bulk import your network from LinkedIn or Google:
    - [**Contacts**](https://every.ai/contacts) → **Import** → **LinkedIn** (upload Connections.csv)
    - [**Contacts**](https://every.ai/contacts) → **Import** → **Google Contacts** (one-click import)
    - Or on the **Home** dashboard → **Import Data** → **Scan Contacts** for AI-powered suggestions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Create a new client named ACME Corp" or "Import my Google contacts" or "Scan my contacts and find potential clients."
</Tip>

### Step 3: Create Your First Invoice

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file-text" title="Build your invoice">
    Go to **Invoices** → **Create Invoice** and:
    1. Select a client
    2. Add line items (description, quantity, rate, tax)
    3. Set payment terms (issue/due dates, PO number)
    4. Add notes or attach files (optional)

    <Tip>Invoice totals calculate automatically as you add line items!</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="check-square" title="Use offerings for faster invoicing (optional)">
    **Offerings** are service/product templates with pre-set pricing.

    Create them in **Offerings** → **Add Offering** → Enter name, description, rate → Save

    Then quickly add offerings to invoices instead of typing details manually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="send" title="Send your invoice">
    Review the preview, then:
    - **Save as Draft** to save without sending, or
    - **Send Invoice** to email immediately

    When sent, clients receive a professional email with:
    - Invoice PDF attached
    - Secure link to view and pay online

    <Note>Draft invoices can be edited anytime before sending.</Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Create an invoice for ACME Corp for $5,000 in consulting services" or "Invoice XYZ Company for the website project, $15,000, due in 30 days"
</Tip>

### Step 4: Set Up Payment Processing (Optional but Recommended)

Enable online payments so clients can pay invoices instantly with credit cards.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="stripe" title="Connect Stripe">
    **Settings** → **Payments** → **Connect Stripe Account** → Complete onboarding (business info, bank account, identity)

    Once connected, invoices include a **Pay Now** button for instant credit card payments.

    <Tip>Clients with online payment options pay significantly faster!</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="credit-card" title="How online payments work">
    With Stripe connected:
    - Clients pay via secure payment page (credit/debit cards)
    - Invoice status updates to **Paid** automatically
    - Funds deposit to your bank account per Stripe's schedule
    - Email notifications for all payments

    **Processing fees**: Typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="hand-coins" title="Manual payments">
    Record offline payments: Open invoice → **Record Payment** → Enter amount, date, method, notes → Save

    Invoice status updates automatically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Connect my Stripe account" or "Record a $5,000 check payment from ACME Corp"
</Tip>
