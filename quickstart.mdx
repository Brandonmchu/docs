## Get Started in Four Steps

Set up your Every account and send your first invoice in 15 minutes.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Organization

Your organization stores your business information, branding, and default settings that appear on all invoices.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="building" title="Create your organization profile">
    Go to **Settings** → **Organization** and fill in:
    - Business name (required)
    - Email, phone, and address
    - Website (optional)

    <Tip>This information appears on all your invoices, so make sure it's accurate!</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Customize your branding">
    In **Settings** → **Organization**, set up:
    - **Brand color** - Used in templates and invoice pages

    In **Invoices** → **Customize**, set up:
    - **Logo** - Appears on invoices and public pages
    - **Note templates** - Reusable text blocks for invoice notes (payment terms, thank you messages, etc.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Configure financial defaults">
    Set defaults in **Settings** → **Organization**:
    - **Currency**: USD or CAD
    - **Due days**: Payment timeline (e.g., Net 30)
    - **Sales tax**: Your standard tax rate
    - **Invoice numbering**: Automatic sequential
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Update my organization name to ABC Consulting" or "Set my default invoice terms to Net 45"
</Tip>

### Step 2: Add Your First Client

Clients are who you invoice. Create them manually — when Google Workspace is connected the email field surfaces Google Contacts suggestions and auto-fills matching details.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-plus" title="Create a client">
    Go to **Clients** → **Add Client** and enter:
    - Name (required) and email
    - Phone, address, website (optional)
    - CC email addresses (up to 2 for invoice copies)

    <Tip>After saving, open the client record, click the more options menu (⋮), and choose **Enrich Client** to let Every Agent pull company details from Gmail, Calendar, and the public web.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="google" title="Scan Google contacts (optional)">
    Connect Google in **Settings** → **Integrations**. On the **Home** dashboard, the **Import Data** card includes **Scan Contacts**, which analyzes your Google Contacts, Gmail, and Calendar. When complete, click to review the suggested contacts and select the ones you want to add as clients. You can also ask Every Agent to "scan my Google contacts and add the clients you find."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Create a new client named ACME Corp with email contact@acme.com" or "Scan my Google contacts and add any that look like clients."
</Tip>

### Step 3: Create Your First Invoice

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file-invoice" title="Build your invoice">
    Go to **Invoices** → **Create Invoice** and:
    1. Select a client
    2. Add line items (description, quantity, rate, tax)
    3. Set payment terms (issue/due dates, PO number)
    4. Add notes or attach files (optional)

    <Tip>Invoice totals calculate automatically as you add line items!</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="list-check" title="Use offerings for faster invoicing (optional)">
    **Offerings** are service/product templates with pre-set pricing.

    Create them in **Offerings** → **Add Offering** → Enter name, description, rate → Save

    Then quickly add offerings to invoices instead of typing details manually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="paper-plane" title="Send your invoice">
    Review the preview, then:
    - **Save as Draft** to save without sending, or
    - **Send Invoice** to email immediately

    When sent, clients receive a professional email with:
    - Invoice PDF attached
    - Secure link to view and pay online

    <Note>Draft invoices can be edited anytime before sending.</Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Create an invoice for ACME Corp for $5,000 in consulting services" or "Invoice XYZ Company for the website project, $15,000, due in 30 days"
</Tip>

### Step 4: Set Up Payment Processing (Optional but Recommended)

Enable online payments so clients can pay invoices instantly with credit cards.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="stripe" title="Connect Stripe">
    **Settings** → **Payments** → **Connect Stripe Account** → Complete onboarding (business info, bank account, identity)

    Once connected, invoices include a **Pay Now** button for instant credit card payments.

    <Tip>Clients with online payment options pay significantly faster!</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="credit-card" title="How online payments work">
    With Stripe connected:
    - Clients pay via secure payment page (credit/debit cards)
    - Invoice status updates to **Paid** automatically
    - Funds deposit to your bank account per Stripe's schedule
    - Email notifications for all payments

    **Processing fees**: Typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="hand-holding-dollar" title="Manual payments">
    Record offline payments: Open invoice → **Record Payment** → Enter amount, date, method, notes → Save

    Invoice status updates automatically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** "Connect my Stripe account" or "Record a $5,000 check payment from ACME Corp"
</Tip>
