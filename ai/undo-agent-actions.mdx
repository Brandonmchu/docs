## Overview

Every Agent includes a sophisticated undo system that lets you safely reverse agent actions. When the agent creates or modifies data, an undo button appears that can restore everything to its previous state.

This gives you confidence to experiment - if the agent misunderstood your request or you changed your mind, you can simply click undo.

## How Undo Works

When Every Agent performs actions that modify your data, a yellow **Undo** button appears below the agent's message showing what was changed.

**What you'll see:**
- **Inline undo button** below agent messages
- **Count of actions** that will be reversed (e.g., "Undo (3 actions)")
- **Hover preview** highlighting which items will be affected
- **Activity Timeline integration** where you can undo from the timeline view

**Undo granularity:**
- Undo reverses the **entire last agent turn** (all actions the agent took in response to your message)
- Cannot undo individual steps within a turn - it's all or nothing
- This prevents partial states where data becomes inconsistent

## What Can Be Undone

Every Agent can undo most data operations:

**Invoices & Proposals:**
- Invoice creation, updates, and status changes
- Proposal creation and modifications
- Line item additions/changes

**Payments & Time Tracking:**
- Payment record creation
- Time entry logging
- Expense records

**Clients & Contacts:**
- New client creation
- Client contact additions
- Client information updates

**Complex Operations:**
- Multi-step workflows (e.g., "create invoice and payment")
- Bulk operations (e.g., "mark all overdue invoices as sent")
- Import results from CSV/data imports

## What Cannot Be Undone

Some actions cannot be reversed:

**External Communications:**
- **Emails already sent** to clients cannot be unsent
- **Payment notifications** already delivered

**Third-Party Integrations:**
- **Stripe payments** already processed
- **Google Calendar events** already created
- **HubSpot syncs** already executed

**Manual Changes:**
- If you manually edited the data after the agent action, undo is blocked
- System detects conflicts and prevents undo to protect data integrity

## Using Undo

### From Agent Messages

1. Look for the yellow **Undo** button below the agent's message
2. Hover over the button to preview which items will be affected (items highlight in yellow)
3. Click **Undo** to confirm
4. System reverses all actions from that agent turn

### From Activity Timeline

1. Go to your **Home** dashboard to view the Activity Timeline
2. Find the agent action you want to reverse
3. Hover over the event - an undo overlay appears
4. Related items in the timeline highlight in yellow
5. Click **Undo** to reverse the action

<Tip>
  The Activity Timeline makes it easy to see the full context of what the agent did and what will be reversed when you undo.
</Tip>

## Limitations & Conflicts

**Only the most recent action:**
- You can only undo the most recent agent action
- Once the agent performs a new action, the previous undo buffer is replaced
- Cannot undo multiple turns in sequence

**Conflict detection:**
- If data has been manually changed since the agent action, undo is blocked
- System shows: "Cannot undo - data has been modified"
- This protects you from accidentally overwriting your manual changes

**One undo per turn:**
- After undoing, you cannot "redo" the action
- The undo is permanent - you'd need to ask the agent again

## Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file-invoice" title="Undo invoice creation">
    **Scenario:** Agent created an invoice with wrong amount

    **You:** "Create a $5,000 invoice for ACME Corp for consulting services"

    **Agent:** "I've created invoice INV-001 for $5,000..."

    **You:** (see undo button) *Oops, should be $6,000*

    **You:** Click **Undo** button

    **Result:** Invoice INV-001 is deleted, all line items removed

    **You:** "Create a $6,000 invoice for ACME Corp for consulting services"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="user-plus" title="Undo client creation">
    **Scenario:** Agent created a client with wrong information

    **You:** "Create a new client named Acme Corporation"

    **Agent:** "I've created client Acme Corporation with ID..."

    **You:** (realize you misspelled company name) *Should be ACME Corp*

    **You:** Click **Undo** button

    **Result:** Client record is deleted

    **You:** "Create a new client named ACME Corp"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="money-bill-wave" title="Undo payment and invoice update">
    **Scenario:** Agent recorded payment and updated invoice to paid

    **You:** "Record a $5,000 check payment for invoice INV-001"

    **Agent:** "I've recorded the payment and marked invoice INV-001 as paid"

    **You:** (realize wrong amount) *Should be $5,500*

    **You:** Click **Undo** button

    **Result:** Payment record deleted AND invoice status reverted to "Issued"

    **You:** "Record a $5,500 check payment for invoice INV-001"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="table" title="Undo bulk operation">
    **Scenario:** Agent archived multiple invoices

    **You:** "Archive all paid invoices from 2023"

    **Agent:** "I've archived 47 invoices from 2023"

    **You:** (realize you meant 2022) *Wait, wrong year!*

    **You:** Click **Undo** button (shows "Undo (47 actions)")

    **Result:** All 47 invoices are unarchived

    **You:** "Archive all paid invoices from 2022"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Review before confirming** - Check the agent's response carefully. It's easier to undo immediately than to undo after more actions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Undo immediately** - If you notice an error, undo right away before the agent performs more actions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use hover preview** - Hover over the undo button to see exactly what will be reversed before clicking.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Cannot undo emails** - Once an invoice email is sent to a client, it cannot be unsent. Always double-check invoice details before asking the agent to send.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

**Undo button missing:**
- Agent may not have modified any data (query-only operations don't need undo)
- Action was too simple to require undo (like answering a question)

**Undo button disabled/grayed out:**
- Data has been manually modified since agent action
- A conflict was detected that prevents safe undo
- Another agent action has replaced the undo buffer

**"Cannot undo" error:**
- Related records have been manually edited
- External systems have processed the data (e.g., Stripe charge)
- Data integrity would be compromised by undo
