## Overview

Every Agent is Every's conversational assistant that understands your business and manages day-to-day operations. Instead of clicking through menus, describe what you need in natural language - Every Agent handles it.

**Core Philosophy:** Every Agent isn't just a chatbot - it's an intelligent system with deep business knowledge, integration access, and autonomous multi-step workflow execution.

## Agent Context & Intelligence

Every Agent knows your business through multiple layers of context:

### Organization Prompt

Your **organization prompt** is custom instructions that shape every interaction. Think of it as an always-present briefing document.

**What to Include:**
- Business description and services
- Target clients and ideal customers
- Communication style preferences
- Pricing philosophy and values
- Special requirements or workflows

**Example:**
```
We're a boutique digital marketing agency specializing in e-commerce brands
generating $1M-$10M annually. We offer paid advertising (Facebook, Google),
email marketing, and conversion optimization.

Typical retainers: $3K-$10K/month. Communication should be professional but
friendly, data-driven, results-focused. Always emphasize ROI.

Default terms: Net 30, detailed line items showing hours and deliverables,
include next month's strategy preview in notes.
```

**How Every Agent Uses It:**
- References your prompt before every response
- Shapes invoice creation, line items, notes, and tone
- Guides email drafting and client communication
- Informs pricing recommendations and maintains brand voice

<Tip>
  Update your organization prompt in **Business Context** workspace. The more specific you are, the better Every Agent understands your business!
</Tip>

### File & Link References

Every Agent accesses reference materials you upload:

**Supported File Formats:**
- **PDF** - Contracts, proposals, reports (with OCR for scanned documents)
- **Excel (XLSX, XLS)** - Spreadsheets, financial reports, data exports
- **Word (DOCX)** - Contracts, proposals, agreements
- **CSV** - Data exports, client lists, transaction records
- **Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP)** - Receipts, screenshots, photos
- **Text (TXT)** - Plain text files

**Other References:**
- **Google Drive Links**: Live documents (proposals, templates, policies)
- **Web URLs**: Your website pages (services, pricing, about us)

**How Agent Uses Files:** Extracts data from spreadsheets, reads contracts for terms, processes receipts for expenses, analyzes reports, and references documents when creating invoices or proposals

### Integration Access

Every Agent connects directly to your integrations:

**Google Workspace:** Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Contacts
**Stripe Payments:** Payment status via database records
**Xero Accounting:** Full access to invoices, contacts, payments, and financial reports
**HubSpot CRM:** Search contacts, companies, and deals conversationally
**Your Business Data:** All clients, invoices, time entries, expenses, offerings

This means Every Agent can say: *"I see ACME Corp paid their invoice yesterday"*, *"You have 3 overdue invoices totaling $12,500"*, or *"Your Xero balance sheet shows $50,000 in receivables"* without you providing context.

<Note>Xero and HubSpot integrations provide agent-powered access - ask Every Agent to look up or manage data in these systems. Connect them in Settings → Integrations.</Note>

### Business Intelligence

Every Agent can run **business intelligence analysis** on demand to synthesize patterns across your data:

**What Gets Analyzed:** Email patterns, calendar rhythms, financial trends, payment behavior, document patterns

**Example Insights:**
```
"Your top 3 clients generate 60% of revenue - consider diversifying"

"Consulting services have 85% margin vs 40% for implementation"

"Average days to payment: 45 days with Net 30 terms"
```

**To Run Analysis:** Click the "Run Analysis" button in the Business Context settings panel or ask Every Agent to "analyze my business performance"

Every Agent references these insights when you ask: "How's my business doing?" or "What should I focus on this quarter?"

## How Every Agent Works

Every Agent operates in **direct execution mode**, handling your requests conversationally and performing actions immediately.

### Direct Execution

Every Agent processes your requests in real-time, executing actions as you describe them:

**How It Works:**
- You describe what you need in natural language
- Every Agent understands the context and performs the action
- Results are shown immediately in the conversation
- Complex multi-step operations are handled autonomously

**Examples:**
```
"Create an invoice for ACME Corp for $5,000 for consulting services"
→ Agent creates invoice immediately and shows you the result

"Send payment reminders to all overdue invoices"
→ Agent identifies overdue invoices and sends reminders in real-time

"Show me my top 5 clients by revenue"
→ Agent queries your data and presents the analysis
```

<Tip>
  Every Agent handles complex operations behind the scenes, breaking them into steps automatically without requiring explicit planning approval.

## Interaction Best Practices

### Be Specific

❌ **Vague:** "Make an invoice"
✅ **Specific:** "Create an invoice for ACME Corp for consulting services, $5,000, due in 30 days"

### Provide Context

**Good Context:**
```
"Create an invoice for the website redesign project with ACME Corp.
Include 40 hours at $150/hour plus $500 hosting setup fee. Net 30 terms."
```

**Why:** Agent knows exactly what to include, no back-and-forth needed, correct pricing applied

### Review Proposals

Every Agent shows what it's about to do before acting:

```
Agent: "I'll create an invoice for ACME Corp with:
- Line item: Website Redesign - 40 hours @ $150/hr = $6,000
- Line item: Hosting Setup (one-time) = $500
- Total: $6,500
- Terms: Net 30 (due [date])

Should I create this invoice?"
```

**Review carefully:** Amounts, client names, line items, due dates

### Iterate Naturally

Every Agent remembers context for refinement:

```
You: "Create an invoice for ACME Corp for $5,000"
Agent: [Shows preview]
You: "Actually make it $5,500 and add a thank you note"
Agent: [Updates and shows revised version]
You: "Perfect, send it"
Agent: [Sends and provides tracking link]
```

### Ask Questions

```
"Who are my top 5 clients by revenue?"
"How many overdue invoices do I have?"
"Which clients haven't been invoiced in 6 months?"
"Show me expenses I haven't billed back to clients"
```

## Advanced Workflows

### File Processing

Every Agent can read and extract data from all the file formats listed above (Excel, Word, CSV, PDF, images).

**What you can do:**
- Extract data from Excel spreadsheets (multi-sheet support)

### Batch Updates

Beyond imports, Every Agent can batch-update existing records:

**Examples:**
```
"Update all clients in 'Enterprise' category to Net 45 payment terms"
"Add CC email accounts@company.com to all corporate clients"
"Archive all clients with no invoice activity in the last 2 years"
"Change tax rate to 13% on all offerings in the 'Consulting' category"
"Mark all unpaid invoices over 90 days as overdue"
```

### Complex Analysis

```
"Analyze my revenue by client for Q4 and create a report showing
top performers, growth trends, and clients at risk"
```

Agent will query data, calculate trends, identify issues, generate formatted report, provide insights.

### Multi-Step Setup

```
"Set up my business for 2025:
1. Create new offering for consulting at $175/hour
2. Update all automations to use new rate
3. Send rate change notice to retainer clients"
```

Every Agent breaks this into steps, shows the complete plan, executes systematically, and tracks completion.
