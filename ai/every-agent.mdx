## Overview

Every Agent is Every's conversational assistant that understands your business and manages day-to-day operations. Instead of clicking through menus, describe what you need in natural language - Every Agent handles it.

**Core Philosophy:** Every Agent isn't just a chatbot - it's an intelligent system with deep business knowledge, integration access, and autonomous multi-step workflow execution.

## Agent Context & Intelligence

Every Agent knows your business through multiple layers of context:

### Organization Prompt

Your **organization prompt** is custom instructions that shape every interaction. Think of it as an always-present briefing document.

**What to Include:**
- Business description and services
- Target clients and ideal customers
- Communication style preferences
- Pricing philosophy and values
- Special requirements or workflows

**Example:**
```
We're a boutique digital marketing agency specializing in e-commerce brands
generating $1M-$10M annually. We offer paid advertising (Facebook, Google),
email marketing, and conversion optimization.

Typical retainers: $3K-$10K/month. Communication should be professional but
friendly, data-driven, results-focused. Always emphasize ROI.

Default terms: Net 30, detailed line items showing hours and deliverables,
include next month's strategy preview in notes.
```

**How Every Agent Uses It:**
- References your prompt before every response
- Shapes invoice creation, line items, notes, and tone
- Guides email drafting and client communication
- Informs pricing recommendations and maintains brand voice

<Tip>
  Update your organization prompt in **Business Context** workspace. The more specific you are, the better Every Agent understands your business!
</Tip>

### File & Link References

Every Agent accesses reference materials you upload:

**Supported References:**
- **Uploaded Files**: PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets (agreements, rate cards, guidelines)
- **Google Drive Links**: Live documents (proposals, templates, policies)
- **Web URLs**: Your website pages (services, pricing, about us)

**How Agent Uses References:** Searches content for proposals/invoices, cites standard terms, uses pricing from rate cards, maintains brand consistency

### Integration Access

Every Agent connects directly to your integrations:

**Google Workspace:** Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Contacts
**HubSpot CRM:** Contacts, deals, pipeline data
**Stripe Payments:** Payment status, refunds, transaction history
**Your Business Data:** All clients, invoices, time entries, expenses, offerings

This means Every Agent can say: *"I see ACME Corp paid their invoice yesterday"* or *"You have 3 overdue invoices totaling $12,500"* without you providing context.

### Business Intelligence

Every Agent runs periodic **business intelligence analysis** that synthesizes patterns:

**What Gets Analyzed:** Email patterns, calendar rhythms, financial trends, payment behavior, document patterns

**Example Insights:**
```
"Your top 3 clients generate 60% of revenue - consider diversifying"

"Consulting services have 85% margin vs 40% for implementation"

"Average days to payment: 45 days with Net 30 terms"
```

Every Agent references these when you ask: "How's my business doing?" or "What should I focus on this quarter?"

## Operational Modes

### Regular Mode

**Best For:** Simple, straightforward requests

**Behavior:** Single-turn execution → Immediate action → Fast response

**Examples:**
```
"Create an invoice for ACME Corp for $5,000"
"Send a payment reminder to XYZ Company"
"Show me my revenue this month"
"Log 3 hours of consulting for Client ABC"
```

### Plan Mode

**Best For:** Complex, multi-step workflows

**How It Works:**
1. **Planning Phase:** Analyzes complexity, creates detailed plan, shows steps for approval
2. **Execution Phase:** Executes each step, shows progress, handles errors, can pause/resume
3. **Completion:** Summarizes results, highlights issues, saves plan for reference

**Examples:**
```
"Import this CSV of 500 old invoices from my previous system"
"Set up monthly billing for all my retainer clients"
"Analyze my Q4 financials and create a revenue report"
"Clean up duplicate clients and merge their invoices"
```

**Plan Persistence:** Plans save to your database - close browser mid-execution and resume later exactly where you left off.

<Tip>
  **When to use Plan Mode:** CSV imports, bulk operations, multi-step workflows, data migrations, complex setup tasks
</Tip>

## Interaction Best Practices

### Be Specific

❌ **Vague:** "Make an invoice"
✅ **Specific:** "Create an invoice for ACME Corp for consulting services, $5,000, due in 30 days"

### Provide Context

**Good Context:**
```
"Create an invoice for the website redesign project with ACME Corp.
Include 40 hours at $150/hour plus $500 hosting setup fee. Net 30 terms."
```

**Why:** Agent knows exactly what to include, no back-and-forth needed, correct pricing applied

### Review Proposals

Every Agent shows what it's about to do before acting:

```
Agent: "I'll create an invoice for ACME Corp with:
- Line item: Website Redesign - 40 hours @ $150/hr = $6,000
- Line item: Hosting Setup (one-time) = $500
- Total: $6,500
- Terms: Net 30 (due [date])

Should I create this invoice?"
```

**Review carefully:** Amounts, client names, line items, due dates

### Iterate Naturally

Every Agent remembers context for refinement:

```
You: "Create an invoice for ACME Corp for $5,000"
Agent: [Shows preview]
You: "Actually make it $5,500 and add a thank you note"
Agent: [Updates and shows revised version]
You: "Perfect, send it"
Agent: [Sends and provides tracking link]
```

### Ask Questions

```
"Who are my top 5 clients by revenue?"
"How many overdue invoices do I have?"
"Which clients haven't been invoiced in 6 months?"
"Show me expenses I haven't billed back to clients"
```

## Advanced Workflows

### Bulk Operations

**CSV Import:**
```
You: "Import this CSV of 500 historical invoices"

Agent:
1. Analyzes structure
2. Detects 500 rows → proposes batches of 100
3. Maps columns to fields
4. Shows preview of first 3 rows
5. Executes with progress tracking
6. Reports: "Imported 500 invoices, 3 warnings"
```

**Batch Updates:**
```
"Update all clients in 'Enterprise' category to Net 45 terms"
"Add CC email accounts@... to all corporate clients"
"Archive all clients with no activity in 2 years"
```

### Complex Analysis

```
"Analyze my revenue by client for Q4 and create a report showing
top performers, growth trends, and clients at risk"
```

Agent will query data, calculate trends, identify issues, generate formatted report, provide insights.

### Multi-Step Setup

```
"Set up my business for 2025:
1. Create new offering for consulting at $175/hour
2. Update all automations to use new rate
3. Send rate change notice to retainer clients"
```

Plan Mode breaks this into steps, shows complete plan, executes systematically, tracks completion.
