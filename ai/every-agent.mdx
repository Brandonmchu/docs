## Overview

Every Agent is Every's conversational assistant that understands your business and manages day-to-day operations. Instead of clicking through menus, describe what you need in natural language - Every Agent handles it.

**Core Philosophy:** Every Agent isn't just a chatbot - it's an intelligent system with deep business knowledge, integration access, and autonomous multi-step workflow execution.

## Agent Context & Intelligence

Every Agent knows your business through multiple layers of context:

### Organization Prompt

Your **organization prompt** is custom instructions that shape every interaction. Think of it as an always-present briefing document.

**What to Include:**
- Business description and services
- Target clients and ideal customers
- Communication style preferences
- Pricing philosophy and values
- Special requirements or workflows

**Example:**
```
We're a boutique digital marketing agency specializing in e-commerce brands
generating $1M-$10M annually. We offer paid advertising (Facebook, Google),
email marketing, and conversion optimization.

Typical retainers: $3K-$10K/month. Communication should be professional but
friendly, data-driven, results-focused. Always emphasize ROI.

Default terms: Net 30, detailed line items showing hours and deliverables,
include next month's strategy preview in notes.
```

**How Every Agent Uses It:**
- References your prompt before every response
- Shapes invoice creation, line items, notes, and tone
- Guides email drafting and client communication
- Informs pricing recommendations and maintains brand voice

<Tip>
  Update your organization prompt in **Business Context** workspace. The more specific you are, the better Every Agent understands your business!
</Tip>

### File & Link References

Every Agent accesses reference materials you upload:

**Supported References:**
- **Uploaded Files**: PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets (agreements, rate cards, guidelines)
- **Google Drive Links**: Live documents (proposals, templates, policies)
- **Web URLs**: Your website pages (services, pricing, about us)

**How Agent Uses References:** Searches content for proposals/invoices, cites standard terms, uses pricing from rate cards, maintains brand consistency

### Integration Access

Every Agent connects directly to your integrations:

**Google Workspace:** Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Contacts
**Stripe Payments:** Payment status via database records
**Your Business Data:** All clients, invoices, time entries, expenses, offerings (including synced data from HubSpot and other integrations)

This means Every Agent can say: *"I see ACME Corp paid their invoice yesterday"* or *"You have 3 overdue invoices totaling $12,500"* without you providing context.

<Note>HubSpot data is synced to your database and accessible via client records, but the agent doesn't have direct HubSpot API access.</Note>

### Business Intelligence

Every Agent can run **business intelligence analysis** on demand to synthesize patterns across your data:

**What Gets Analyzed:** Email patterns, calendar rhythms, financial trends, payment behavior, document patterns

**Example Insights:**
```
"Your top 3 clients generate 60% of revenue - consider diversifying"

"Consulting services have 85% margin vs 40% for implementation"

"Average days to payment: 45 days with Net 30 terms"
```

**To Run Analysis:** Click the "Run Analysis" button in the Business Context settings panel or ask Every Agent to "analyze my business performance"

Every Agent references these insights when you ask: "How's my business doing?" or "What should I focus on this quarter?"

## How Every Agent Works

Every Agent operates in **Plan Mode** by default, which provides structured execution with guardrails, tracking, and error recovery.

### Plan-Based Execution

For most requests (except trivial chatter like greetings), Every Agent creates a structured plan to ensure:
- Step-by-step execution with progress tracking
- Error handling and recovery
- Ability to pause and resume complex operations
- Clear audit trail of what was done

**When Plans Are Created:**
- CSV imports and bulk operations
- Multi-step workflows requiring coordination
- Data migrations
- Complex setup tasks
- Any request that requires multiple operations

**When Plans Are Skipped:**
- Simple greetings and acknowledgments
- Quick single-action requests (like viewing data)

**Examples of Plan-Based Workflows:**
```
"Import this CSV of 500 old invoices from my previous system"
→ Creates plan: validate CSV → batch into groups of 100 → import each batch → verify results

"Set up monthly billing for all my retainer clients"
→ Creates plan: identify retainer clients → create automation for each → configure schedules → test

"Clean up duplicate clients and merge their invoices"
→ Creates plan: find duplicates → review matches → merge records → update invoices
```

**Plan Persistence:** Plans save to your database - close browser mid-execution and resume later exactly where you left off.

<Tip>
  Plans provide safety and transparency for complex operations. You can see exactly what Every Agent will do before it happens.
</Tip>

## Interaction Best Practices

### Be Specific

❌ **Vague:** "Make an invoice"
✅ **Specific:** "Create an invoice for ACME Corp for consulting services, $5,000, due in 30 days"

### Provide Context

**Good Context:**
```
"Create an invoice for the website redesign project with ACME Corp.
Include 40 hours at $150/hour plus $500 hosting setup fee. Net 30 terms."
```

**Why:** Agent knows exactly what to include, no back-and-forth needed, correct pricing applied

### Review Proposals

Every Agent shows what it's about to do before acting:

```
Agent: "I'll create an invoice for ACME Corp with:
- Line item: Website Redesign - 40 hours @ $150/hr = $6,000
- Line item: Hosting Setup (one-time) = $500
- Total: $6,500
- Terms: Net 30 (due [date])

Should I create this invoice?"
```

**Review carefully:** Amounts, client names, line items, due dates

### Iterate Naturally

Every Agent remembers context for refinement:

```
You: "Create an invoice for ACME Corp for $5,000"
Agent: [Shows preview]
You: "Actually make it $5,500 and add a thank you note"
Agent: [Updates and shows revised version]
You: "Perfect, send it"
Agent: [Sends and provides tracking link]
```

### Ask Questions

```
"Who are my top 5 clients by revenue?"
"How many overdue invoices do I have?"
"Which clients haven't been invoiced in 6 months?"
"Show me expenses I haven't billed back to clients"
```

## Advanced Workflows

### CSV Data Import

Every Agent includes a powerful CSV import wizard that can import hundreds or thousands of records from spreadsheets - perfect for migrating from another system or bulk-loading data.

#### What You Can Import

**Supported entities:**
- Clients (companies and contacts)
- Invoices (historical invoices with line items)
- Payments (payment records)
- Expenses (expense records with receipts)
- Offerings (service/product templates)
- Time entries (logged hours)

**Best for:**
- Migrating from another invoicing system
- Importing historical data for analytics
- Bulk client onboarding
- Loading past invoices for payment tracking

#### How CSV Import Works

**Step 1: Upload CSV**
```
You: "Import this CSV of historical invoices"
[Attach CSV file to chat]
```

**Step 2: Analysis**
Agent analyzes your CSV:
- Detects entity type (invoices, clients, etc.)
- Counts rows (e.g., 500 invoices found)
- Identifies columns (Client Name, Amount, Date, etc.)
- Checks for required fields
- Proposes batch size (typically 50-100 rows per batch for reliability)

**Step 3: Column Mapping**
Agent shows proposed mapping:
```
CSV Column          →  Every Field
─────────────────────────────────────
Client Name         →  client.name
Invoice Number      →  invoice_number
Invoice Date        →  issue_date
Amount              →  total
Due Date            →  due_date
Description         →  notes
```

You can correct mappings:
```
You: "Map 'Customer' column to client.name instead"
Agent: [Updates mapping]
```

**Step 4: Preview & Validation**
Agent shows preview of first 3-5 rows:
```
Preview Row 1:
  Client: ACME Corp
  Amount: $5,000.00
  Date: 2024-01-15
  Due: 2024-02-14

Preview Row 2:
  Client: TechStart Inc
  Amount: $12,500.00
  Date: 2024-01-20
  Due: 2024-02-19

✓ All required fields present
✓ Dates in valid format
⚠ 3 clients don't exist yet (will be created)
```

**Step 5: Execution**
```
You: "Looks good, proceed"

Agent: Starting import...
Batch 1/5: Processing rows 1-100... ✓ Complete (2.3s)
Batch 2/5: Processing rows 101-200... ✓ Complete (2.1s)
Batch 3/5: Processing rows 201-300... ✓ Complete (2.4s)
Batch 4/5: Processing rows 301-400... ✓ Complete (2.2s)
Batch 5/5: Processing rows 401-500... ✓ Complete (2.0s)

Import complete!
  ✓ 500 invoices created
  ✓ 47 new clients created
  ⚠ 3 rows skipped (invalid data)

```

#### Handling Import Errors

**Common issues:**

**Missing client:**
- **Problem:** Invoice references client that doesn't exist
- **Solution:** Agent creates new client automatically using name from CSV

**Invalid date:**
- **Problem:** Date in unrecognized format
- **Solution:** Fix in CSV or tell agent: "Use MM/DD/YYYY format for dates"

**Duplicate invoices:**
- **Problem:** Invoice number already exists
- **Solution:** Agent skips duplicates or you can specify: "Append -IMPORT to duplicate invoice numbers"

**Missing required fields:**
- **Problem:** Row missing required data
- **Solution:** Agent skips row, reports in summary

<Tip>
  **Ask Every Agent:** Handle import errors:
  - "Skip rows with missing client names and show me which ones"
  - "For duplicate invoice numbers, add '-OLD' suffix"
  - "Create new clients for any client names not found"
</Tip>

#### Import Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start small** - Test with 10-20 rows first to verify mapping before importing thousands
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Clean data first** - Remove empty rows, fix formatting inconsistencies in Excel before uploading
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Backup first** - If importing to production, export existing data as backup
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use consistent dates** - Stick to one date format (YYYY-MM-DD recommended) throughout CSV
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Check preview carefully** - Review sample rows to catch mapping errors before full import
</Tip>

#### Advanced Import Features

**Reusable import scripts:**
If you import similar CSVs regularly (like monthly expense reports), Every Agent can reuse the mapping:

```
You: "Import this month's expense report using last month's import script"
Agent: "Detected same structure, reusing mapping from January import..."
```

**Conditional imports:**
```
"Import invoices but only for clients with @acme.com email domain"
"Import expenses and mark all as billable to ACME Corp"
"Import clients but skip any already in the system"
```

**Progress tracking:**
For large imports, you can close the browser and come back later:
```
Agent: "Import in progress (Batch 8/20)... You can close this window."
[Later, you return]
Agent: "Your import finished 10 minutes ago. 1,000 records imported."
```

### Batch Updates

Beyond imports, Every Agent can batch-update existing records:

**Examples:**
```
"Update all clients in 'Enterprise' category to Net 45 payment terms"
"Add CC email accounts@company.com to all corporate clients"
"Archive all clients with no invoice activity in the last 2 years"
"Change tax rate to 13% on all offerings in the 'Consulting' category"
"Mark all unpaid invoices over 90 days as overdue"
```

### Complex Analysis

```
"Analyze my revenue by client for Q4 and create a report showing
top performers, growth trends, and clients at risk"
```

Agent will query data, calculate trends, identify issues, generate formatted report, provide insights.

### Multi-Step Setup

```
"Set up my business for 2025:
1. Create new offering for consulting at $175/hour
2. Update all automations to use new rate
3. Send rate change notice to retainer clients"
```

Plan Mode breaks this into steps, shows complete plan, executes systematically, tracks completion.

## Getting Started

### First Conversation

1. **Simple query:** "Show me my last 5 invoices"
2. **Create something:** "Create a test invoice for $100"
3. **Multi-step task:** "Import this CSV of 20 clients"
4. **Ask for insights:** "What are my most common services?"

### Customize Your Context

1. **Set Organization Prompt** - Describe business, services, preferences
2. **Upload Reference Files** - Agreements, rate cards, brand guidelines
3. **Connect Integrations** - Google Workspace, Stripe, HubSpot
4. **Test:** "Create an invoice for my standard consulting service" - verify Agent uses your rates and terms
